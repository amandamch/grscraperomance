0,0,Book Lovers,Emily Henry,0,2022-12-22,emma,4,"welcome to my main character era.i love emily henry.i’ve loved her since the first incarnation of my reading accounts, when i discovered a million junes based on an act of love from the universe, probably, and never looked back.i loved her fascinating, unique, sometimes creepy always lovely magical realism filled with banter and growth and stunning images.when she moved to romance, her books felt less like My Books, ones written specifically for me, but it was kind of wonderful to see them be The Book for so many other people.and then this one came along.and i hate to center myself again, but…just kidding. this is the same person who genuinely said yesterday that the rain was holding out for her walk home exclusively. i have no problem with indulging in narcissism, so:this one feels pretty made for me.i love sisters, and here our almost-as-important close-second relationship after the romance is between two crazy close sisters.i love nora, our cold and tough and mean but on the inside very kind and lovely and of course book-obsessed protagonist. (it will come as no surprise that i relate to her. or, well, relate on the first and third points.)i love charlie, who passes my single requirement for romance novel love interests with flying colors. (this single requirement is, of course, being obsessed beyond logic with our main character.)i love banter. it is the best part of any romcom and it isn’t close. this has plenty.i love having it all happy ever afters. i love when the magic perfect ending doesn’t just include love, but like 9 other neatly tied up subplots ending with confetti and rose petals or whatever too.i love being a tall girl, and i love that this book recognizes our struggle!!! (see second slide.)i love dream jobs. i love tropes. i love mean-girl characters. i love little kids. i love books!!!when it came to this book, it feels like i loved it all.bottom line: emily henry forever!!!(making this 4.5 for now subject to 5 upon reread)---------------pre-reviewplease respect my privacy at this time (deciding whether to give my third romance five star ever).review to come / it's either 4.5 or 5---------------currently-reading updatesthis is the best day of my life---------------tbr reviewanyone have any tips on hibernation?"
1,0,Book Lovers,Emily Henry,1,2022-05-26,Emily May,4,"
All these years spent thinking I had superhuman self-control, and now I realise I just never put anything I wanted too badly in front of myself.
Yeah, I agree with the general consensus that this may be the author's best yet. I actually felt so-so about Henry's People We Meet on Vacation and almost gave this book a miss, but my friend convinced me to pick it up and I am glad I did. Book Lovers checks all my boxes for romance-- fun banter, hardass heroine (can't deal with blushing damsels), a guy who might have his broody moments but isn't a d*ck, and steamy encounters.I'll get my one complaint out of the way and say I think we could have safely lost fifty or so pages of family angst, which pretty much always feels like filler in romance books like this. Outside of that though, this was a hit. In addition to the usual stuff I like, I also really appreciated how the author made use of their careers-- she a literary agent, he an editor --to challenge, point fun at, and subvert the romance genre's tropes. As a badass, hardworking city gal, Nora has been left by multiple past boyfriends for wholesome country women who bake and dutifully pop out kids. She's the b*tch in this trope; career-driven, ambitious, and particular about the shoes she wears, obviously not the kind of woman someone wants to be with in the long term. When her sister suggests a getaway to the country and, who knows, maybe her own country romance, Nora reluctantly comes along. There she meets, not a sexy lumberjack, but none other than Charlie-- a fierce editor from back in the city.I love how this book doesn't change Nora or punish her for being ambitious and hardworking. It's so true that men are allowed to be obsessed with their work, whereas women who do the same are too often treated as if they have an illness. I'm glad that's not the case here. I always hated to see powerful women tamed."
2,0,Book Lovers,Emily Henry,2,2022-05-04,chan ☆,2,"i didn't like this :( but i have reasons so let's discuss:1. nora. god i so desperately wanted to love her. she's kind of stony and bitchy and so am i, ergo match made in heaven? not so much. the stony exterior was great but the immature center was irritating. i could understand her motives in wanting to keep her sister happy but her inability to solve problems and ask straight forward questions and allow her sister autonomy... big oof.2. libby. her character was never fleshed out enough to be even a little interesting. she has 2 outbursts throughout the story and each time i thought they'd be break throughs in making her have something to really say. but no. she had a different perspective on her upbringing than her sister which was interesting enough but her life wasn't interesting enough to have motivations. she has babies, that's all i gathered.3. charlie mcblandbland. he definitely feels more like gus than alex, which i guess makes sense given the similarities between beach read and book lovers. but beyond a decent sense of humor and some tragic backstory i again, did not find him interesting. i could feel emily henry attempting to make him a perfect match for nora with the older sibling, never picked by girls shtick but the sexual tension fizzled after the first encounter. boo.4. setting was not my fave. i've heard people say it's schitt's creek-y but there aren't enough charming characters to make that a thing. did i like anything?i suppose i can admit that there is some growth on the part of nora. she chases her dreams, lets a man into her life, and finally lets her grown ass sister be a grown ass adult. but that's kind of it. feels mean to do it but it's a 2 star read for me. at least beach read had that jaw dropping moment of unrequited love/mutual pining."
3,0,Book Lovers,Emily Henry,3,2022-07-04,Cindy,5,"Book Lovers does a lot of things right with subverting Hallmark movies with a cold girlboss protagonist who, instead of changing her ways or mentality, is still appreciated for who she is and what she values, especially by the love interest. I like that being career-oriented, valuing independence, living in the city, and being childless are qualities that aren’t villainized nor expected to change in order to have a happy ending. The banter is fun, and I can see how the MC and love interest pair really well together. What gave the book more depth, though, was its focus on the MC’s own issues and relationship with her sister. This helped round the story to be both a combination of romance and interpersonal/family struggles.Perhaps I just have low standards when it comes to 3rd act conflicts in romance books, but I was impressed with how the author tackled this one. Rather than relying on misunderstandings, the conflicts presented felt more realistic and honest. I was even more surprised that there were not one, but multiple realistic conflicts that made it difficult for the MC to have her happy ending - and I appreciated that, because that's how life actually works. “There’s no happy ending for a woman who wants it all.”Sometimes it gets little info-dumpy for the sake of characterization and relationship building, and one could argue that the love interest isn’t fully developed, but I’m OK with letting these things slide. Book Lovers has much more positive things going on than negative, so I’m totally fine with rounding it up to 5 stars."

Here’s my digital art I’ve designed for this book to celebrate its publication day! https://www.instagram.com/tv/CdG3Md7j...I’m speechless! I’m head over heels for this book!This is the best romance story I’ve recently read! The smartest enemies to lovers trope I’ve ever devoured!  This is absolutely best work of the author and probably my winner for 2022 best romance reads that earned my full vote for Goodreads Awards Choice in romance category! I think Nora ( named after Ms Ephron who gave us the best taste of romcoms) and Charlie were the best MCs the author has created! I cannot have any words in my vocabulary to describe my feelings for this book! But if I had chance to give 1 billion stars, I would do it without thinking any further!This time I’m not gonna give anything away because I still had hard time to gather my wits after the emotional intensity effect of my amazing experience. So you gotta read and find out!I’m gonna stop my blabbering session! Just read it, buy to your all loved ones! This is unique literature feast that you shouldn’t miss out!

5,0,Book Lovers,Emily Henry,5,2022-04-14,Ayman,5,"i’m already convinced Emily henry personally writes to me in her books and this book just proved it. this book is made for book lovers by a book lover. and it is especially made for the older sister who has a younger sister.i fucking love these characters with all my heart. idk i just feel like Emily can create some of the best characters that eventually become my comfort characters. Nora is complex, deep, funny, and relatable. She’s like blood dripping from fangs as Emily describes it. Charlie says all the right things. i love the way Charlie can read Nora like a book (pun intended) i love the way Emily henry describes the men in her books. Their chemistry was tangible. Their emotions were deep. They are beautifully flawed puzzles pieces that fit together. i admire them so much. if there’s anything emily henry can put her whole ass and tits into, it’s creating the best characters. the ending had me squealing and running laps around the neighborhood. it was so cute and wholesome.  Emily henry’s writing is so unique to me and refreshing. she’s always been one of my comfort authors. i feel like she’s THAT white woman who is MY white woman. she writes for poc first, i’m convinced. she deserves to get her ass ate for birthing this masterpiece that’s all.also i think i love this just as much as Beach Read. like i can’t choose one over the other. i hold them both dear to my heart. "
6,0,Book Lovers,Emily Henry,6,2021-12-27,jessica,5,"i wish i was capable of a teaspoon of the banter, humour, and snark that comes out of charlie and noras mouths. they are seriously a match made in heaven. but OTPs are nothing new for EH. she has a real gift when it comes to creating a connection and understanding between two people. i loved her YA books, but writing adult romance is her true calling in life. what i adored most about this particular book is how it doesnt take itself seriously. there is some serious themes and content, but the overall vibe is very ‘lets poke fun at hallmark movies,’ which i enjoyed. the big city girl in a small town trope always works for me, so it was fun to have her fall for a big city boy as they are both stuck in the small town together. both charlie and nora work in publishing, so i think the story might feel too meta at times for some readers, but i personally didnt mind it. i think this is a fantastic addition to EHs bibliography. if you enjoyed her other books, you will definitely want to add this to your TBR, as its very much the same charm and wittiness and romance she has made herself known for.a massive thanks to berkley for the ARC!!↠ 5 stars"
7,0,Book Lovers,Emily Henry,7,2023-02-22,SK,2,"Read by a book lover who didn't love this book🙂Don't get me wrong, it's no doubt so well written. The prologue and the first few chapters are brilliant. But soon after, it became incredibly dull for me. It didn't have the 'wow factor.' The characters are just bleh (sorry not sorry). I found Nora to be slightly more likable than Prem's dick- Charlie (Dating Dr Dil reference that has the potential to ruin any love interest named Charlie). So Charlie is just bland...like the rest of the book. The concept is not new. I found it to be similar to Beach Read but in a very uninteresting manner. I wanted to like this book but simply couldn't. It did not work for me. But I would still suggest to give it a try, you might end up liking it more than me🤷‍♀️"
8,0,Book Lovers,Emily Henry,8,2023-02-13,Jesse (JesseTheReader),4,"I appreciated how deep the romantic relationship went in this one. A lot of romance books I read feel surface level at times, but this one felt very meaningful. The sibling relationship was a big highlight for me with this book and seeing them work through a big hurdle together was one of my favorite elements. "
9,0,Book Lovers,Emily Henry,9,2022-12-19,Emily (Books with Emily Fox),5,"I'm usually not big on romance...Quite frankly I'm often hoping the main female character will realize that the douche-canoe she's dating needs to be dumped but... this one was cute!

10,0,Book Lovers,Emily Henry,10,2022-05-17,Taylor Reid,None,"Nora is a ruthlessly ambitious literary agent who identifies more with the villains in romance movies than the heroines. Swayed by her sister to spend the summer together in a picturesque small-town, the last person she expects to run into is Charlie—the surly editor she’s avoided ever since their disastrous first meeting. Modern and fresh, this is a must-read for rom-com lovers."

18,0,Book Lovers,Emily Henry,18,2022-07-25,Val ⚓️ Shameless Handmaiden ⚓️,5,"5 Huge Stars""I'm not ashamed of my upbringing, but the more you tell a person about yourself, the more power you hand over.""I've been trying to write a review for this book that was about the actual book and not just a bunch of TMI about me, but...the struggle is real. For that reason, I will probably be keeping this short so as not to overwhelm ya'll with a bunch of personal information no ones cares about. As all we crazy power readers know, sometimes it's timing...sometimes it's your mood...sometimes it's that you feel as if the characters were made from you and that you just get them. This book was all three for me. And I just loved everything about it. The pop culture references...the witty banter...the tongue in cheek meta-talk about romance novels and their cliched characters...the writing itself. All of it. Loved it. Every second. I mean, just look at this:""This place looks like a Cracker Barrel had a baby with a honky-tonk, and now that baby is a teenager who doesn't shower enough and chews on his sweatshirt sleeves.""^I wish I had written that. What did I love most though? Nora. I ADORED her. Because I basically AM her. In so many ways. And, crazy as it sounds, being with her in these pages made me feel like I was hanging out with a friend who accepted me for exactly who I am. Here are some of my favorite quotes:""...barking heartless advice from the seat of her Peloton bike. You can tell she's evil because her hair is an unnatural blond, slicked back a la Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct, and also, she hates Christmas decorations.""""That's the thing about women. There's no good way to be. Wear your emotions on your sleeve and you're hysterical. Keep them tucked away where your boyfriend doesn't have to tend to them and you're a heartless bitch.""""I'm a career woman with a weekly housekeeping service, a spare bedroom I turned into a shoe closet, and a Sephora credit card.

My favorite person's a pregnant woman! And I'm obsessed with my nieces.

Yes, I loved Nora. I also loved Charlie and just Nora and Charlie together. Their banter was absolutely delicious and the way they just understood each other...the things romance dreams are made of, folks. Anyway, I'll stop this gush fest here as I've pretty much slobbered all over the computer screen. There is more, but again, TMI. Plus, the Peloton is calling my name."
19,0,Book Lovers,Emily Henry,19,2022-06-06,mina reads™️,3,"Featured in this vlog: https://youtu.be/uXzba5_oHAMEmily Henry is an incredible talent and this book proves that she’s brilliant at writing nuanced protagonists with stunning romantic chemistry. Nora and Charlie were just pitch perfect together. I will however say that I think this book is poorly marketed by labeling this as “rivals to lovers” because they simply are not rivals. They barely know each other and have had a vaguely bad first meeting but that does not a rival make. But I digress, they were fantastic together and Charlie made me swoon so many times! I loved all of their scenes and their love confessions actually made me cry. If only the book was solely about them, however this book also focuses on Nora’s complex dynamic with her younger sister, Libby, and while I think that dynamic was well explored I personally simply did not care. It takes up so much of the narrative and so much mental space for Nora that her romance actually felt like a side plot to her relationship with Libby. The story just did not feel balanced particularly because it is marketed as a romance and her relationship with Charlie is not centralized nearly as much as her relationship with Libby. Also this book is incredibly meta and because the characters are in the publishing industry, they are hyper aware of the character archetypes and narrative tropes they fall into. Which is cute at first but felt a bit grating to me after a while. I’m conflicted, love Nora and Charlie, but I’m not sure I loved the book. 3.5 stars"
20,0,Book Lovers,Emily Henry,20,2022-09-08,kio,1,LMAO WHAT IS THISSSS i have never struggled through a romance book as much as i did with this one??? nora? mid. charlie? mid. libby? mid. i’m sorry but there is not a single thing about this book that makes up for the fact that there is no substance to it. it feels like emily henry considered every trope that sells and decided to bunch them all up and incorporated them into this mess of a book. some of it was just so unappealing. i’m so disappointed:(i was so into the siblings relationship until they unironically referred to each other as “sissy” PUH-LEASE
21,0,Book Lovers,Emily Henry,21,2022-06-02,Chelsea (chelseadolling reads),5,"It will surprise absolutely no one when I say that I adored this book. It made me simultaneously miss the heck out of New York but also want to call up my sister, get on a plane to Small Town, USA™ and just lose myself for a weekend with nothing but my kindle and an empty stomach. Emily Henry just has such a knack for writing books that feel like they were written specifically *for me* and I truly have yet to be disappointed. While I don’t know that this is my favorite of her novels (I love them all so much that it’s honestly kind of pointless to try to play favorites aside from writing this review lol), I am confident that the ending of this book is not only my favorite of her endings, but possibly one of my favorites book endings of all time? I read the last 50 pages twice and cried just as hard at the ending both times. I couldn't have dreamed up a better conclusion if I tried. Oh, also, Charlie is an absolute dream boat and I love love loved both him and Nora SO. FUCKING. MUCH. Emily Henry just has *such* a gift and I am so excited to spend the rest of my life reading her stories. Happy, happy sighCW: death of a parent, minor pregnancy complications"
22,0,Book Lovers,Emily Henry,22,2022-05-26,Hannah B.,2,"✨...I would…take the vasectomy over this✨To get it out in the open: No this is not a bitter rivals book at all, no she’s really not an ice queen and it’s literally not a secret, no he is most certainly not Roy Kent (even accidentally), and no the romance isn’t ultimately central to the story. I found this to be more of a sister relationship story with a romance subplot. The romance/relationship was basically reserved acquaintances to quick fondling friends. I thought I could love it but I just couldn’t keep making excuses or trying to convince myself that the next page would have the moment I’ve been reading for.If I was really trying to start something, I’d call this Frozen fan fiction. I mean seriously the word frigid is used enough, and the amount of ice/ice queen/frozen/ice in my body/I’m literally a block of ice with eyes language is astounding.I honestly don’t foresee many people having my same reaction to this book. I think it’s a fine, easy read but absolutely nothing special. Emily Henry’s name attached will make it special to a lot of readers and that’s fine. Sally Thorne is that kind of author for me. I thought it had potential, a lot of it, but it ultimately fell so flat. That disappointment made me the most upset. I gave it 2.5 stars for the “fine” easiness of it, but I didn’t round up because I think it could’ve been more than fine but it wasn’t and that’s the boob punch. Full review below. Sorry if I’ve wrecked your dreams of this one. Personally, I didn’t like it but I’ve been told I’m petty. This is the part I should say “but I hope you love the book!” But my previously established petty ass will forever and always choose to write about how misery loves company and that I’m saving you a seat. ✨Overview:I was hopeful. I read the first 67% of this book super fast. I was t h r i l l e d that I was enjoying my time. I love to love books. I want to love books. It’s so much easier to love books. But I think looking back on that first two-thirds of the book, I was ignoring small and irritating things because I r e a l l y wanted to love this book. The relationship was cute, if surface level, and while the book was absolutely not rivals to lovers, I still liked the set up.But I was waiting for that spark to happen. That b i g revelation in the relationship when tensions are high and trust is fragile. The “I have a l w a y s loved you” painted bedroom or even the errant vasectomy (iykyk) big reveal. Something shocking or surprising or different. My kingdom for s o m e t h i n g. Anything. I really thought we’d get one. Instead I got a whole lotta Libby (main heroine’s sister), a weirdly placed Hallmark “Big City Person turned Small Town Person and Local Store Savior” moment, and book metaphors. So many book metaphors. (Thinking about it now, the “something” twist was here I guess…but it’s not regarding the romantic relationship so no dice and it wasn’t even interesting. It made a could be interesting plot point uninteresting.)✨Steam:I knew the last third of the book would feature their inevitable sex scene, but before we got to the Big Penetration Sensation, the moment that would wrap this book up with a bow, I was finally trapped by too many irritating things. They piled up to a height I couldn’t ignore; a height that cast a m o s t a g g r i e v e d shadow over the nice and tidy nothing special five-orgasms-in-one-sex-scene sex scene. Since I was already annoyed by the time we got to The Sex, the language was just way too flowery and metaphorical for me. I don’t care what the idea of Charlie feels like. Or just how much he resembles a book. I just want to know how he feels in your v a g i n a. The phrase “we fall into each other” made me want to gag. Just say you fucked goddamnit y’all are falling into each other all over the place! Ya topsyturvy mofos.I will say the sex was definitely more than I thought we’d get. There were three almost sex scenes prior to the Rolie Polie Olie fan fiction. The language went to the extent of “nipples” and “erection” but they did their jobs. The three prior scenes were each hot because the locales were super hot: front door, midnight pond, library. I think this is Emily’s hottest book. I would be fine with this sex/steam level in another book… with the one caveat that I actually like the rest of the book.✨Characters:Libby pushed me too far with her not being able to understand that Nora had a job and couldn’t just take three weeks off from work. Nora only worked until 5PM and took O N E phone call and Libby just had to puppy dog eye it. Nora was so self-sacrificial when it came to Libby. Yes I was annoyed at Libby, but goddamn girl take a hint and stop trying to help! She kept *covertly* throwing money at her sister it was weird. She gave up a lot of things and was about to do it again! She got some huge news and was like “but I’m so selfish for even wanting this during Libby’s midlife Hallmark crisis.” And when Nora finally got to lay into Libby, we were interrupted in such an eye roll way. Literally for fuck’s sake. It was my Rocky montage cut short by an untied shoelace and a face-plant into a bunch of stairs. I thought Charlie was pretty okay until he took a stab on the now communal blade of self-sacrifice. Out of nowhere, and only for the sake of previously non-existent tension, ol Chuck just had to fuck up his entire life for zero reasons. Nobody asked you for this rite of stoically unhappy passage sir. It was too much. This book was supposed to be a bloodthirsty shark and her grunting, broody nemesis. We got a minnow and a dude in a hoodie.  She wasn’t really frigid, icy, or unfeeling at all. He wasn’t Roy Kent. He wore black once and I grunted more than he did. They had one semi-bad lunch two years ago that apparently made them rivals (it didn’t). I get that “underneath it all” she wasn’t supposed to be frigid or icy, but literally her exterior was just as nice and normal as her lukewarm inner self.✨Plot:He was an editor; she was an agent. He rejected a book (about an old man’s dog dying, fun!) she pitched. Two years pass and now that profound dog death book is a best seller. Her sister is having a Moment and wants to travel to the real town of this—thankfully—fictional dog death book. A book described as if that Sarah Machlaclan commercial just ended with a basket of dead puppies. The agent finds the editor is also in the obscure small town, a big *shock.* She shows him the die-puppy-die author’s most recent manuscript and it’s so good! brilliant! fucking amazing! perfect! for no reason at all because it’s frankly quite bad! (You really don’t get any actual details to turn the idea of that manuscript into a plot that makes sense so… gotta trust their Midas touches there I guess.)Since the author is *fragile,* frigid shark lady (?) must make sure the mean stormcloud dude (?) isn’t too mean. Yes the shark is actually being nice because she’s literally a nice person who rides a Peloton because she likes it. She was nothing at all like Margaret Tate—I love Margaret Tate. There’s nothing beneath the surface of either of the main characters, at least nothing intriguing. You get the basic plot points that check off the basic plot point list (including a great love for lists!). Her peloton is shoved so far down your throat you’re basically training for the Tour de France. The author seemed to think that owning a Peloton is the hallmark of a bitchy person so if she just! keeps! mentioning! pelofuckington! we’ll have to start to believe Nora is an unfeeling ice cube with thighs of steel. Of course, it’s really supposed to show us that nice people can be blonde and ride Pelotons too, but it was just… poorly done. I thought the concept was fun at the beginning: Nora is the Big City girlfriend that the Big City boyfriend in a Hallmark movie dumps for the Small Town baker/Christmas tree farm heiress/struggling bed and breakfast owner because the Big City girlfriend is too blonde and too toned from the stationary bike she wants to fuck more than him. Cool but just so… not about that at all? How can that character be so boring??? Nora never proved to me that she had ever been a poisonous bitch worthy of Bob Spaulding’s scorn. Although she did declare herself “Heathcliff”…but I also think she likes Heathcliff…so back to square one. ✨Conclusion:By trying to subvert so many tropes, this book just reverted back to every other trope. Congratulations ya played yourself. I think parts were definitely meant to be tropey, but I don’t think the book really meant to be so wholly predictable and unsurprising. There was nothing about this book that would make me pick it up again or anything that makes it stand out from the crowd. The relationship was so…blah by the end. Maybe I’m the frigid wench because I felt nothing akin to warm and fuzzy. Again, I liked this book for a lot of the book, but that was basically all hinged on the assumption that the relationship would go somewhere interesting and I’d be naming him the honorary mayor of my vagina. Once it was clear I wasn’t going to let Charles anywhere near a large pair of ceremonial scissors, the shiny, bright ribbon fell away and I was pissed. All the small annoying things just snowballed into Heat Miser territory and I literally broke into a musical number. So sorry family. That emotional and romantic payoff ending (and the big “I love you” “prove it” scene) was sacrificed for pages and pages of Libby and her bookstore charity case. The relationship got like the last two pages. Of course, more than a few pages were devoted to their “gut-wrenching” but oh so “righteous” split up. I initially said this was Emily Henry’s most romancey romance but I take it back. It ended up being way more about Nora and Libby than about Nora and Charlie. It is evident in the scope of the ending.Just go watch The Proposal instead.⭐️⭐️.5/5 🌶🌶.75/5Spoilerish idfk: P.S. Really, when a character hasn’t cried for over a decade, there are certain expectations in a romance. Just saying. You don’t wait the whole book to cry and then cry over something other than the penis attached to the love of your life. You don’t make it your entire character trait and then wait until cry number four to cry over him. Ya just don’t. *Thank you to the publisher for an advanced review copy! I really thought we had one bois I really did."
23,0,Book Lovers,Emily Henry,23,2022-05-04,Warda,5,"So, this is love… This is a 5 🌟 worthy read. Nothing less and everything more. My feelings towards this book are bordering on not normal. They’re intense. Anyone else experience slight breathing problems when they are *that* immersed in a story? Because the writing is so good and the characters are even good-er and you can’t wrap your mind around the fact that a story like this exists because of how well it speaks to you?Okay, I’m calming. I’m calming down. All I really knew going into this was that this was a book about books and I kept it that way intentionally. That’s all I needed to know. Partially because I like going into books somewhat blind but also because I trust Emily Henry to write a story that has all the right ingredients.And I was right. I got everything that I was expecting and wanted and way more! Once I reached the ending and closed up the book, I felt calm and rejuvenated and fulfilled. Thanks to all the crying. I can’t wait to reread this again. It’s reread-worthy. 
Thanks a million to Viking Books UK for sending me an ARC.

This book had the most amazing small town vibe w such funny moments and yet so much depth too??? unreal. Nora was everything, I think everyone will see so much of themselves in her! & Charlie? obsessed. Their banter and conversations were my favorite thing, and the relationships & friendships within this book were amazing. I’m in love with everything about this, but are we even surprised?"
25,0,Book Lovers,Emily Henry,25,2022-05-25,booksandzoe,4,"I think my ranking of Book Lovers in the EH canon is 3rd out of the 5 that I've read. I was kicking and squealing at the banter, the writing was superb as always, and I really enjoyed reading the ""grumpy x grumpy"" dynamic which was very unique to the typical romance/WF novel. I didn't feel the same level of /completely understood/ as a person that i felt from the characters of January Andrews or Alex Nilson, but there were still definitely moments when I just started crying because certain lines were so me. I think audiences will love this just as much as they've loved Henry's prior two adult novels; it carries the same charm and authenticity that shines through the EH canon."

“The last-page ache. The deep breath in after you’ve set the book aside.”
The moment Emily Henry announces a new book, i rush to add it to my tbr and mark the release day on my calendar.Book Lovers had me in a choke hold. It was a bit different to BR and PWMOV but amazing nonetheless. I loved the romcom vibes of this one. I laughed so much and even though the romance moved fast it felt really genuine. The chemistry between Charlie and Nora was 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥Also can we please take a moment of silence to acknowledge the magnificence of Charlie Lansra 🙏🏽🕯️Besides the cute small town setting and the hate to love romance, what i really adored was the sister relationship in this book. I too have an elder sister who is so similar to Nora and it was like getting a little insight into her mind. Book Lovers was fun and heart warming and everything i expected in a Emily Henry book.Thank you to Penguin Random House for sending me an ARC for review____I'm not even gonna bother reading the synopsis. Its Emily Henry. And it has people reading on the cover. What else would i need to know?!*slaps credit card down repeatedly*"
28,0,Book Lovers,Emily Henry,28,2022-08-12,fatma,3,"I was disappointed by Book Lovers, here's a review in point form:• My biggest issue with this book is that I simply didn't feel strongly about any of it. When I read a romance novel, I need to feel strongly about said romance--it can be a fun, lighthearted romance, or an angsty, hardhitting romance, but regardless of tone, all I want at the end of the day is to feel deeply invested in the characters' relationship. Needless to say, I didn't feel that way about Nora and Charlie. I didn't feel one way or the other about them, really. Their interactions were fine--and frankly, the worst thing aside from outright hating a romance is to think that it was fine. Fine is boring; it's lukewarm; it's forgettable. (Unsurprisingly enough, I've already started to forget this book even though I literally finished it yesterday.)• As to why I thought the romance was mediocre, there are a lot of reasons. Namely, it wasn't developed slowly enough. There wasn't enough of a buildup, and the buildup is the best part of the romance: the tentativeness, the second-guessing yourself, the realization that you actually like this person, the tension--all of that was missing here. With the exception of their first encounter, Nora and Charlie pretty much immediately hit it off, and, like, good for them, but it's not very interesting for me as a reader to just have all that fun buildup stuff almost entirely skipped over. • Emily Henry writes some really great banter in this (it's one of the few things I truly loved about this book), but banter does not a good story make, and the overarching structure of the romantic plotline was lacking. It was too vanilla in that it just wasn't dramatic enough: there was very little conflict, or a sense of there being narrative ups and downs. There were inconveniences and half-truths and little misunderstandings, sure, but there was just no underlying sense of actually significant highs and lows in the story (at least with regard to the romantic plotline).• I feel like the whole time I was reading this, I was waiting for something to impress me--some ""wow"" moment that would stop me in my tracks--but it just never came. Part of that is the hype--a third Emily Henry romance!!!--and part of that was just my own expectations: I wasn't especially taken with Beach Read, but I loved People We Meet on Vacation--structurally, it's one of the most well executed romances I've ever read--and I thought (or hoped) that Henry's stories were on an upward trajectory. Sadly, this was a major step down for me. It wasn't bad, but it was underwhelming, which ultimately means give it a couple of weeks and I will pretty much have completely forgotten about this book. • Some additional little gripes: first, the writing is overly sentimental sometimes, especially when Nora is waxing poetic about how much she loves New York and how much of a City Person she is. Like okay, we get it, you love the bodegas and trains or whatever, no need to tell us about it for the umpteenth time. • Second, as with Beach Read, the fictional novel that Henry makes up for this book--a novel that Nora's author client, Dusty, is in the process of writing--sounds awful. Like it truly sounds so bad, and the fact that the characters talk about it like it's a literary masterpiece that they simply have to get their hands on boggled my mind.• And third, I found it really annoying how Nora constantly had to babysit Dusty. Nora's workaholic tendencies are a big part of the book, so it was surprising to me that this was never addressed in any way. Nora is fielding phone calls from this lady left and right to coddle her and give her pep talks and make sure she's doing okay and like!!! Sure it's your job to make sure your client feels supported and all, but the way that it's written here makes it sound like Nora is just there to manage Dusty's emotions 24/7. That's not part of your job, Nora !!!!!"

You can do this!!!! You only have 99% left!!!! It's not that bad!!"" i was about to do some jumping jacks to get the adrenaline going.i was this close to tears several times - and not because Colleen's writing is in any way shape or form moving to me - it's because i don't even want to look at this, let alone read it.here's what i liked:this scene - ""Does Cupcake girl have a name?"" ""Everyone has a name.""it has absolutely zero relevance to the plot. it's barely a scene, but people say to start criticism with something positive, so here you go.the list y'all actually want - there will obviously be SPOILERS:🕴️the emoji has no significance, i just thought it's funny🕴️ i have never liked CoHo's writing. idk, it's just trying too hard to be poetic and deep without having this nice and flowy feel to it that actual good poetic prose has🕴️this one is especially fake deep because there is like nothing that deep going on with the plot🕴️it was mostly just boring🕴️CoHo always tries to tackle those heavy themes and i have yet to see her manage that in a good way. this time it's driving under the influence of alcohol. Kenna drives drunk and kills her boyfriend and then instead of calling for help, she leaves because she thinks he is dead and she is afraid of the consequences. It turns out that Scotty wasn't actually dead and lived for another six hours just lying there somewhere on the side of the road, left alone to die.Kenna could (should) have called the ambulance, even if she thought he was already dead. She didn't. She served 5 years for this in prison. CoHo wants you to feel sorry for her (""But it's five years."" ""It was one mistake."" ). No. She KNEW she was drunk. She STILL drove, DESPITE being drunk. She got into an ACCIDENT BECAUSE SHE WAS DRUNK. She DIDN'T call an ambulance because she thought Scotty was already dead, which is NOT a good excuse to not call an ambulance. She just LEFT. That man SUFFERED for SIX more hours before he DIED. And you want me to feel sorry for her? No.🕴️Kenna has a child in prison, that gets taken away by Scotty's parents who are very adamant about her never seeing her again. Now i know nothing about child protection laws and whatever and i don't know whether Kenna should have been given the right of seeing her daughter again, let alone getting back the privilege of having some sort of custody but both Scotty's parents and Ledger treated her like a lunatic that would just kidnap the child and then get into another car drunk and killing her as well. Ledger went as far as accusing her of being ""selfish"" as if it wasn't apparently clear that she just wanted to see her child at least once. If she was indeed what Ledger pretended she was why go back at all? If she was as selfish and heartless and a stone cold killer as they all made her out to be she would have surely just stayed away, glad that she didn't have to be in the kid's life?Do biological parents deserve the right to be in their childrens' lives? Probably not, depending on the circumstances, but the way they treated her at points was just ridiculous.So was Kenna just trying to show up at their doorstep one day though. There are official channels to do it. I don't think the American system is that broken that a mother could not try to get her child back, even if she doesn't have any money.🕴️the romance in this was - as it always is in CoHo's books - way too insta lovey. Ledger had his wedding vows ready the time he first caught a glimpse of her. on page 10. i am just tired of this instant attraction bullshit. where's the build up? why would i want to read someone go ""She is all I can think about. Her face is like a painting. I want to give her all my attention"" ten pages in? i don't even know the characters yet and you expect me to root for them already? give me at least some build-up please. do y'all just go out and fall in love with people the second they walk in? i'm sorry but i just don't believe this🕴️shouldn't Ledger also hate her for killing his best friend? he gets over that pretty fast and actually betrays the trust of the child's guardians by showing Kenna pictures of her child, which was totally not his place to do. he's known those people for his entire life, he practically co-raises that kid but throws it all away for a woman he barely knows and who killed his best friend? make it make any kind of sense🕴️CoHo really said diversity✨ in this one and made sure to mention that Ledger hired black and hispanic people in his bar. it's truly a win against racism today🕴️ it's also a win for the LGBT community because CoHo made Kenna question her sexuality for an entire half sentence!!! 🕴️ we love authors who give us representation 🤧🕴️ i can't say anything about the ending: i have read spoilers and it sounds bad and i know i haven't missed anything🕴️CoHo tries to make her readers emotional by giving her characters tragic backstories (why does someone always accidentally kill or injure someone in her books though) and then throwing them into the most convoluted circumstances. it's always so obvious and fake deep and the deep conversations she's trying to have aren't even done right and she somehow always manages to romanticize or excuse fucked up behaviour that should neither be romanticized nor excused.i'm done. y'all have fun though. 1 star."
31,1,Reminders of Him,Colleen Hoover,31,2022-01-23,Ayman,5,"colleen hoover put her whole colussy into this one…and she delivers once again. this goes down as another colleen hoover book that i devoured and ate tf up!my favorite thing about these books are the writing and characters. without even really noticing it, i found myself relating to Kenna (mc) and the emotions she went through. her growth and self forgiveness was the best thing to read through out the novel. she proves people make bad decisions but that doesn’t mean they are bad people. she shows that in her selflessness and fight. Ledger was an interesting character to read about. at times i was so enthralled by him. he was introduced as the dude that owns a bar, former NFL player, drives a truck, and tattoos?!?! like what more could i want ?!! 😍 and then there were moments that i was so heated and angry that i wanted to punch sense into him. he was a hard character to grow on but at last he charmed me. seriously, i couldn’t decide if i wanted to back hand slap him or ride him. i chose the latter…hehehehehehdid i find myself crying uncontrollably? abso-fucking-lutely! it wouldn’t be a colleen hoover book if not tf? i made the mistake of bringing this book to work to read to make the time pass by. 2 hours into my shift i find myself crying, sobbing, and shaking uncontrollably. my co-workers notice and the first thing i say is “oh allergy season” and that’s a complete fucking lie because it’s fucking snowing outside but you can’t let the boss find out that you’ve been hiding in a corner reading an incredible book instead of doing the work you’re actually hired to do… warning: do not bring CoHo books to work! you are setting yourself up for disaster! but fortunately the crying wasn’t even entirely because of sad scenes or anything traumatic, it was the scenes towards the end that left the biggest smile on my face. things really came full circle. i usually skip over acknowledgements but i read this one and i encourage you to do the same. my favorite line even came from the acknowledgments not the story itself. now idk what to do with my life?!? guess i’ll drive into the sunset to fill this void this book left me with. (good void)"
32,1,Reminders of Him,Colleen Hoover,32,2022-01-27,jessica,5,"well. once again, CoHo had me crying ugly tears at 2am because thats just the kind of author she is.i felt different reading this one. instead of the usual butterflies and heart flutters her books normally give me, this feels very raw and heavy. its definitely a life story more than it is a love story. i will say that although kennas determination to be a good mom to her daughter is worth reading about, ledger totally steals the show. he is put in an unfathomable position and i think CoHo has written his character very well. so even though this didnt make me feel as light-hearted as i usually do with her books, i did feel something. admiration. grief. hope. discouragement. anger. but also happiness. it ends on a good note. <3↠ 4.5 stars"

36,1,Reminders of Him,Colleen Hoover,36,2023-03-16,Yun,4,"With Reminders of Him, Colleen Hoover cements her status as queen of the emotional read.You'd think having read so many of Hoover's books, I would be better prepared. One, always have a box of tissues ready. Two, never read it in public. But I haven't learned my lesson. This time, I was in the doctor's office, sitting in the waiting room, when I got walloped with the feels. I tried to pass it off as allergies, but sobbing and allergies don't exactly look the same, you know?Kenna has just been released from prison, where she served her time for an accident that had forever altered the course of her life. She returns to the town where it all went wrong, in the hopes of being reunited with the daughter she's never known. But old grudges die hard, and the town isn't so ready to welcome her back. The only ally she may have is Ledger, owner of the local bar, who has his own ties to her past.This book sure packs a punch. I don't know if it's just where I am in my life currently, but reading about Kenna's separation from her daughter was particularly painful and heartbreaking. It was hard not to cry through most of it, if I'm being honest. The other thing that really struck a chord with me is Kenna's hope for a second chance after having done her time. It's still pretty rare for literature to include this important theme, and I'm always so heartened to see it.There are so many sides to this story, so many different ways of looking at it. There's no real right or wrong, just lots of gray in the middle. It wouldn't surprise me if a lot of readers felt strongly that Kenna's situation is too harsh or too lenient. And I certainly wouldn't be surprised if those two groups ended up overlapping, with the same readers feeling both. This is exactly the sort of story that balances on an edge, tugging your heartstrings one way, then another.If I had one quibble, it's that the pacing of the story felt a little bit off. The middle part dragged on for longer than necessary without much in the way of plot advances. Then when we get to the end, the resolution happens seemingly out of nowhere, without any of the anticipated pushbacks. After the odyssey that was the journey, the ending felt a bit abrupt to me.Still, Colleen Hoover is known for delivering eminently readable stories, and this is just as riveting as the rest. Though she puts so much emotional toil into them, they never make me want to turn away. I want to continue flipping the pages. I want to feel whatever emotional punishment she has in store for me. And that's what makes her stories so special.Just don't forget my two tips if you're going to read this. And maybe I'll even remember them myself one day.My heartfelt thanks for the copy that was provided for my honest and unbiased review.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:It Ends with Us / It Starts with UsVerityRegretting YouUgly Love Layla ~~~~~~~~~~~~"
37,1,Reminders of Him,Colleen Hoover,37,2022-02-02,Warda,5,"Fuck you, Colleen Hoover! You had no right to make me cry like this.The last 10% were just rude. When I tell you I was looking hideous whilst ugly crying..I was sobbing as if I was Kenna.I experienced ALL the feelings that came with this story but by the end I was left genuinely happy. Kenna DESERVED that ending. This story embodies pain. Something CoHo is known all too well for. She strikes the balance of stories that seem so far out there - out there to my own world view - with so much care and heart.I knew I would love it as soon as I read the synopsis, but I was not ready to be bombarded with these intense emotions. And it's interesting to see how these complicated feelings were expressed by all parties involved in this story. All were valid. And it makes you think what your own reaction would've been like.Ledger and Kenna are a lot more nicer than I am, because if it was me, I'd be fighting and knocking some sense into these old ass people. They were quite frankly asking for it. There were so many moments where the feelings they expressed just felt so disrespectful and were out of line.But it is easy for me to say the above because I had a clearer picture of what was happening and the characters necessarily didn't.All to say that the sentiment is true: hurt people hurt people.
""You think you know how you’ll react in a terrifying situation, but that’s the thing. You can’t think in a terrifying situation.""
I respect the hell out of Colleen Hoover."
38,1,Reminders of Him,Colleen Hoover,38,2022-01-26,gigi hadidn’t,3,"3 stars 💫🚨 Spoiler Alert 🚨 - ​(proceed with caution I spoil pretty much everything...)💙 The Plot 💙Kenna Rowan, a 26-year-old single mother has just been released from a 5-year prison sentence for the involuntary manslaughter of her boyfriend Scotty Landry, during a car accident with Kenna in the driver's seat. After her release, with $2000 to her name, she moves back to the town where it all began hoping to reunite with her 4-year-old daughter Diem, who was taken from Kenna as soon as she gave birth in prison, as Scotty's parents Grace & Patrick gained full custody. On her first day back in town, she meets an enigmatic bar owner Ledger Ward, who along with his floppy hair and tattoo's intrigues her for the first time since meeting Scotty. The two share an intense night, with an instant connection until Kenna realizes that Ledger is Scotty's best friend. 💙 The Characters 💙Kenna - There's a thing between me and CoHo heroines where I don't particularly like them that much, I only feel for them through their situations rather than their personalities (except for miss verity, she is and will always be an icon, a legend, and the moment evil villain or not). But Kenna? Oh my god, my heart actually broke for her countless times, so much so I kept screaming in my head when will someone give this poor girl a break. From her neglectful childhood, an absentee dad to a mother whose narcissism and lack of parenting resulted in Kenna being put in foster care twice, and then later on not developing a safe relationship with her mother, Kenna hadn't been dealt a good hand in life. Until she met Scotty. 
""When women say they’ve been to prison, people think trash, whore, addict, thief. But when men say they’ve been to prison, people add badges of honor to the negative thoughts, like trash, but badass, addict, but tough, thief, but impressive.""
I loved her strength, she had zero money to her name but she didn't care, all she wanted was to see her baby that was ripped away from her arms. She got a job working minimum wage as a grocery bagging assistant, she worked extra hours for Ledger at his bar as a dishwasher all so she could prove her worth to the Landry's and be able to see her daughter Diem. People judged her for what happened that night, but she was distressed to the point where it lead her into pleading guilty because she felt like she needed to be punished for that accident, when in fact the truth is both Scotty AND Kenna were high/drunk and got in the car. Yes, one died, but both needed to be held just as accountable or just as innocent. When Kenna lost all hopes of ever having custody of her daughter she turns to her mother, who is so horrible I wanted to slap the bitch all the way to Australia. Her mother is so bitter and resentful that Kenna was ungrateful to her for saving her from foster care (and then still proceeding to emotionally abuse and neglect her daughter), she refuses to even apply for visitation rights or half custody of Diem so that Kenna would at least be able to see her daughter whilst in prison. What I will add further is - something that really annoyed/confused me was the events of the actual accident. It was said that Kenna left the scene of the accident because she was so in shock from believing that Scotty is dead she WALKS AND WALKS until she magically ends up in her apartment, and wakes up the next day to the police breaking down her door to arrest her? HUH??The logistics ain't logiSTICKING.I don't understand how someone who is in shock, covered and drenched in blood walks for MILES upon MILES, knows exactly where they have to walk to find their way back home after crashing in the middle of nowhere... it's so sus. Scotty - Scotty and Kenna's love was so pure, told through the hundreds of letters that Kenna had written to him whilst in prison. They met when Kenna was 20, working as a cashier and Scotty kept coming back to buy one plate every time just so he could see her. 
“I rang up the plate and said, “You know, you can buy more than one thing at a time.”“I know,” you said. “But I only need one plate.”“Then why is this the fourth one you’ve bought?”“Because I’m trying to work up the nerve to ask you out.”
That same night they went on their first date, Scotty actually broke up with his girlfriend that same day just so he could take Kenna out 😂 and the next 6 months flew by as they fell head over heels in love. I loved how sweet their relationship was, Kenna had never known love or stability like it before and Scotty gave her all that and more. His parents didn't approve of Kenna, the one time she went to their house to meet them they heard her and Scotty have sex, saw her holding Scotty's cigarette, and assumed it was hers and as Kenna never had a good relationship with her own mother, she found it hard to talk to Scotty's mother Grace. My favorite Scotty and Kenna scene is definitely when they were at this shop looking at rings, and Kenna found the perfect one but it cost $4000, so instead, he bought her 10 little rubber hands that sit on the tip of your fingers. Later on, we find out that Scotty had in fact asked the help of his family to buy that expensive ring for when he was ready to propose to Kenna 😭 I truly believe that Kenna is not over Scotty and never will be. Throughout the whole book I felt as if Scotty was developed more as a character/love interest than Ledger, circumstance brought Kenna and Ledger together with a sprinkle of lust. Legder - I was ready to crown Ledger as my fav CoHo book boyfriend, but honestly the energy of Ledger from the first few chapters until the end of the book? It was highly uninspired. He lacked depth as a character, we didn't know much about his personality at all apart from that he used to be a professional NFL player, was engaged to be married until a month ago, and owns a bar.Most of his personality was developed around him fighting the inner battle of believing whether Kenna is good or not. He was a nice enough hero, but there was nothing special or groundbreaking about him. I didn't believe in his love for Kenna, everything about their coupling felt forced and forged only by the bond they share through Diem and the loss of Scotty. He was a nice guy, then he was an asshole, then he was nice again and being concerned for Kenna's mental health, offering her a job, and wanting to kiss her even though he shouldn't. Once Kenna read her letter recounting the events of the accident out loud Ledger made his mind up. He fell in love with her. In the space of 200 pages he was so up and down I got whiplash but how are we expected to believe in their love when they maybe spent a few days in total together? Most of their interactions happened during brief encounters or him going to her apartment to say his piece and then going back. I feel like giving us the 'Reminders of Scotty' I fell more in love with him and Kenna than I did with her and Ledger. It wasn't a competition but the dead guy wins hands down. Me to Ledger:Grace & Patrick Landry - aka Scottys parents... I can sit here and tell you I felt for them. They lost their only son due to what they believe is a careless accident. Kenna in a fit of shock from the accident believes that Scotty is dead when she checks his hand/pulse (which also I'm sorry but Kenna could've checked other areas of Scotty's body like erm IDK HIS NECK before she ran from the scene thinking he's dead???) and runs away to ask for help but then wakes up in her own bed the next day, when in reality Scotty was still alive, the hand she checked was crushed with the blood supply cut off. In the courtroom, Kenna showed no emotion outwardly, when inwardly she had accepted her sentence as her penance, which made Scotty's parents hate her even more. They had every right to feel and be upset, they took Diem and raised her for the first 5 years of her life, but when Kenna came back they were so terrified and full of hatred for her they took out a restraining order against her. I'm not going to sit here and shame them for their very human reaction, but what I will say is it's always hard to root for these characters when you can feel the pain of the main character who is portrayed as this villain. But what I really didn't like is how rushed the whole ending was, how as soon as they read Kenna's letter (with less than 50 pages to go towards the end of the book) everything was miraculously forgiven and Kenna FINALLY met her daughter (I repeat all of this happened within 50 odd pages). No. I do not want that. I wanted more of the angst and pain I was promised. All that emotional turmoil Kenna went through and suddenly everyone is welcoming her this quickly?? I needed them all to feel way more guilt than that!!! Kenna should've died period. Then we can see who would cry at her funeral 😂. I really wish the ending was a lot more impactful than the route that CoHo chose which was magically wrapping everything up with a pretty little bow and HEA. I didn't view this book as a romance, this to me was Kenna's book, and if something different happened such as Kenna leaving after cutting her losses and reuniting with Diem years later? Her publishing a book of her letters and Diem finding her through that? Grace & Patrick forgiving Kenna regardless of the letter? I just wish more options were explored, rather than rushed. Roman - Ledger's best friend and one of the 3 side characters that were the stars of this book for me. We can call him a semi-grump, but can we all band together and think of ways to destroy cupcake shop girls' marriage so Roman can have her? I love a good unrequited/forbidden love. I loved the little bits of Roman we got, he was the only one who was understanding towards Kenna and didn't judge her for her mistakes. This man was delicious and he wasn't even the hero. 
“You think she cooks as good as she bakes?”“Hopefully one day I find out. Almost one out of every two couples divorce,” he says, his voice hopeful.“I bet Whitney could find you a nice single girl to date.”“Fuck you,” he mutters. “I’d rather wait until Cupcake Girl’s marriage falls apart.”
Diem - unfortunate name aside (I got the sentiment from Kenna but really girl??? if she gets bullied, at least I know my girl will be able to defend herself) she was a queen. authors who write funny children have my heart and Diem was the funniest and sweetest girl. I want whatever Diem is eating. 
“D, you can’t take all the T-balls.”“They’re dragon eggs,” she says. “I’m going to plant them in my yard and grow baby dragons.”“It takes more than a wish to make a sibling.”“I know. We have to buy an egg from Walmart. That’s how babies grow.”
 Lady Diana aka Lucy - Is Lady Diana my favorite CoHo character ever? yes. as she deserves. LD lives in Kenna's apartment complex, works at the same grocery store as Kenna, befriends her as her first friend, and has Down's Syndrome. I love how welcoming and protective of Kenna she is, so much so she calls Ledger a jerk after he makes her cry. Look at this iconic behavior, your favs could NEVER:
“Are you leaving with the jerk?” she asks Kenna.“You can stop calling him a jerk now. His name is Ledger.”Lady Diana looks me up and down and then mutters, “Ledgerk.”
When she finds a cute guy and proclaims that she will marry him, LD knows her priorities:
“Is he nice?” I ask her.“He has a PlayStation.”“But is he nice?”“He has lots of Pokémon cards.”“Is he nice, though?” I repeat.She shrugs. “I don’t know. I’ll have to ask him.”
💙 Overall Thoughts 💙Reminders of Him was a thoughtful and poignant story of a woman who was dealt one too many bad hands in life, making a way for herself in the shattered remainders of the life stolen from her. Colleen did a great job in making us feel every bit of Kenna's pain and root for her reunion with Diem which should have been epic and heartfelt. But overall the pacing of the story was off, rapid in some places (such as the ending, romance between Ledger and Kenna) and dragging in others (how long it took for her to meet Diem, the focus on secondary characters, which I enjoyed reading about but felt the focus was shifting too much). The emotional impact of the story was lacking for me, bar the times I teared up for Kenna. This book needed another 100 pages minimum just to really solidify the plot, emotional connections, and ending. I would still recommend this as a read for those of you who enjoy Colleen's emotional books such as: It Ends with Us & All Your Perfects."
39,1,Reminders of Him,Colleen Hoover,39,2022-01-15,Jessica ,3,"3.5No one is more sad than me that I didn't love this book. I've only seen rave reviews, so I was expecting to love this one, but it didn't really feel special? It just felt like an emotional romance about a woman trying to get her daughter back after being in prison for five years. This read much more women's fiction until about 200 pages in when the romance started to get more focus. Since this is a Colleen Hoover book, I was expecting something shocking or some sort of twist somewhere throughout the book, but nothing like that happened. Everything, to me, was predictable and I saw every plot point coming. And the ending was so convenient and just wrapped up so quickly. One thing was the answer to all of their problems and that caused the ending (sorry for being vague, but I don't want to spoil anything). I will say, this is a book that will make you frustrated on behalf of all of the characters. There is no easy answer for anything and you understand why all of the characters are making the decisions they make. I felt for these characters, but there was just nothing special about this book. It was an emotional story about a woman in a helpless situation wanting to be part of her daughter's life. There was a bit of a romance. That's really it. "

Colleen Hoover always brings the feels with her contemporaries. I went into this one blind, like I always try to do with her books, and I was overcome with all I felt. It brought me to tears more than once and it had deep and heavy topics, but also moments of lightness that made me laugh. I love books that can do both. It’s the perfect balance. Some mistakes are bigger than others. Some mistakes are life changing. Life ending. Kenna is at a place she hasn’t been in five years and she’s there for a reason. Or a person. One of the main themes in this book is forgiveness. Kenna struggles with forgiving herself and others struggle to forgive her. Ledger meets Kenna and he doesn’t know who she is at first. He’s drawn to her. It’s almost magnetic. Once he finds out who she is he struggles with how he should feel about her. Ledger was the perfect hero, and one of this authors best characters. Kenna was also great and getting to know her through her letters to Scotty made me love her even more. I love that Colleen let us feel for Kenna and gave us so much insight in her heart and head through letters that when we found out what had happened, we couldn’t help but feel sympathy for her. I was sympathetic towards everyone in this book. Each of their situations were unique and I could understand why they felt the way they felt. There were no good guys or bad guys, just imperfect human beings. Like a lot of Hoover’s books, even though I would definitely classify this as a romance, it wasn’t only a romance. There were so many other facets to this story. It was a story of family, forgiveness, grief, and love. It’s heartfelt, emotional, and truly unforgettable. Reminders of Him is a book that will be on my mind for some time, as well as my favorites list! I highly recommend this one!

43,1,Reminders of Him,Colleen Hoover,43,2022-01-24,Sophie,1," dnf @69% Yes, I made it roughly 70% through this tragic book before I allowed myself the grace to stop reading it. I wanted to like it! I really did, I swear. But I had a lot of problems with it.Kenna has been in prison for the last five years for involuntary manslaughter. She hit her boyfriend with her car while drunk, wandered away from the crash site, leaving him for dead. When her prison sentence is over, she uses her savings to move to the small town where her 4-year-old daughter, Diem, resides with Scotty's parents. Kenna gave birth to her daughter at the very beginning of her prison sentence and all of her rights were terminated. On her first night in the city, she goes to a bar, where she meets a very handsome bartender. Only later, as she is kissing him, does she realize that he's her dead boyfriend's best friend. She keeps kissing him anyway and they almost have sex in his truck.Ledger puts some pieces together early on in the book and figures out who Kenna really is.  Aside  from the whole still-kissing-Ledger-when-she-knows-he's-her-dead-boyfriends-best-friend thing, my heart truly went out to Kenna in this story. I think that's why I kept reading for so long, I was waiting for everyone to have empathy for her, to try to put themselves in her shoes and forgive her. I mean- imagine how traumatic it would be if you accidentally killed the love of your life, and the only thing he left you with was immediately taken away from you as soon as it came into existence?? That is freaking devastating. And no one in this book gives a f77king sh2t. First thing's first, everyone in this book except for Kenna, Scotty, Lady Diana, and the grocery store manager  completely sucked.  Ledger and Scotty's parents- bad. I did not like them.They all make Kenna out to be this cold-blooded murderer, who hit Scotty with her car and then left him for dead on purpose because she was ""trying to get away with murder."" Like- SHE WAS LITERALLY  SH8T FACED DRUNK.  I get that they're upset about their son and they want someone to blame, but we are adults here, people. Freaking adults, act like it. Ugh. Ok, let's talk about Ledger. First of all, why does Colleen Hoover give all of her characters made-up trailer trash names? Why? Aside from Ledger's  incredibly  ridiculous name, he is an awful human being. He is just plain selfish. I understand him acting the way he did when he didn't know who Kenna was, and maybe being a little upset she didn't say anything and kept kissing him when she figured out who he was. Understandable. What I  don't  understand is everything he did that came after that. He has-  no  empathy for Kenna, is completely disgusted with her, and the whole time he goes on about how Kenna is ""just using him to get to Diem"" when he's the one who keeps randomly picking her up in his truck and inserting himself into her life. And then he offers her a job- to help her out. Well, ok. But he only gives her the job because he has feelings for her. And the whole time he's being an ass to her and saying she's scum, and then he's getting all salty and possessive when she  talks to her co-workers.  PUH-LEASE. Not to mention that he's her boss at this point and he knows he's one of her only sources of income, he keeps putting her in sexual situations where it's arguably hard for Kenna to say no.And I know that Kenna likes Ledger, for some reason. I know this. But it just seems so hypocritical of Ledger to tell Kenna that she's using him to get to her daughter when he's the one who's shoving his tongue down her throat and coaxing her into having sex with him. Also, Ledger kept harassing Kenna to show him the letters she writes to Scotty and that is totally none of his business. She said no. When a woman says no, you don't keep asking her until she says yes. I feel like overall... this was just executed poorly. The male lead was a hot and cold mess and the romance felt forced. The point where I had to stop reading this was when Kenna and Ledger finally had sex, it just felt so off and weirdly paced. I wish this book had more prison stories and flashbacks with Scotty, those were the parts that I actually enjoyed. Overall, disappointed. /:"
44,1,Reminders of Him,Colleen Hoover,44,2021-11-14,Gabby,4,"Wow, this was a super tough read. Colleen Hoover is known for having super emotional romance stories and this book is no exception. Sometime I'd feel so frustrated with these characters I'd want to scream and then the next page I'd be crying. Ledger is definitely the highlight of this story for me, I felt so much for his character and he gets put in such an awkward situation in this book. I love that I can always count on Collen Hoover books to make me feel ALL of the things! Here's the reading vlog where I read it: https://youtu.be/w5W0oMYsS3k"

Made me f cry the entire last fifty pages or so.My heart is not broken anymore after reading this wholesome book.Here we are following a story of a woman who is trying to make things work after being in jail for a crime she’s not wholly responsible of.She has to find her child and start living a normal life. But life isn’t that easy.And then there’s this guy who’s been bringing up this adorable child.With a friend he has lost and busy running a bar, he wouldn’t let the one who has ruined his friend’s family to interfere with his life.But then again life isn’t that easy to predict.I absolutely adore this story. I cried when the book hit the last fifty pages or so. It’s totally heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time.The book is about hope, new beginnings and love. It’s about losing someone close to you and grief. But it is also about family and remembrance.One of my all time favourites now....I wish there were more parts of the kid Diem.... She's an awesome kid. I want a second part of the book.I need the connection between the child and the adult characters. I miss that in the entire book."

“People say you fall in love, but fall is such a sad word when you think about it. Falls are never good. You fall on the ground, you fall behind, you fall to your death.”
Okay CoHo, You finally wrote a book that made me cry. 

THIS WAS A FUCKING PIGEON.

 I can now say that I have loved two books by her out of what I have read thus far, but truly this one takes the cake. Consumed it in one sitting. I felt every emotion from every side and had a complete understanding of each side's views. I felt like I was being pulled back and forth in a battle of loyalty and betrayal just like Ledger.
“It was a stark realization that no matter how much you love someone, you can still do despicable things to them.”
It's been just over five years since the night that changed everything for Kenna Rowan. An accidental tragedy at her hand sent her to prison where she gave birth to a baby girl Diem, never to be in her custody. Now that Kenna is released, she is determined to earn forgiveness and finally meet her four-year-old daughter, but they want nothing to do with her. She finds comfort and support from Ledger Ward, someone who she never thought would ever give her the light of day.
“It proves that time, distance, and devastation allow people enough opportunity to craft villains out of people they don’t even know.”
This book really makes you see the grey areas of the comparable black and white. Not everything is what it seems and without even trying to understand the full picture for your own benefit, you are closing off the peace you utterly are craving. This book was depressingly dark in a way I never want to experience—there's a difference between being alone and being lonely. Now add trauma and regret on top of that.
“Grudges are heavy, but for the people hurting the most, I supposeforgiveness is even heavier.”
I couldn't help but root for Kenna—no matter the circumstance, I feel a mother should have the right to have a relationship with their child or at least know them. I couldn't help my anger and frustration over her being closed off and pushed away without any chance at redemption or chance at showing her true character. Accidents happen, and based on the evidence, things were not looking great for Kenna, however, everyone deserves that opportunity.
“Crying seems to be the only thing left in life that I’m good at. Crying and making bad decisions.”
When all the odds are against you and nobody is in your favor and you just CAN'T catch a break, you become broken. Luckily, Kenna was able to get Ledger on her side but that doesn't mean the journey wasn't rocky and chaotic. This truly felt like a no-win kind of story and I knew that when it came to fighting for what was needed, it was going to be painful and outright heartbreaking.
“Is that . . . is that a fucking pigeon?”
The storm aside, this was a complete and happy ending and the epilogue had tears streaming from my eyes in stinging happiness. Kenna was so deserving of the life she ended up with and everyone could finally be at peace. ""Hi Scotty"" <3
“Now that I've forgiven myself, the reminders of him only make me smile.”


*Trigger warnings*:

Suicidal thoughts, (somewhat) detailed scene of a tragic car wreck with driver under the influence, child neglect of mc (talks of foster care), (light speak) misuse of prescription drugs"
48,1,Reminders of Him,Colleen Hoover,48,2022-08-31,Ali Goodwin,4,4.5 stars! Eee Colleen Hoover does it again. I love Kenna and Ledger so much and their love for Diem. Such a heart felt book with so much depth. Colleen Hoover really got me crying in another book 😭❤️ really loved this book

I loved how Ledger didn’t give up on her, kinda hated him at first but then he got me. I kept saying one more chapter and now it’s 6 am. I LOVED IT"

I was so attached to these characters, and I just wanted to reach into the book and give them all a million hugs. The way the cover and the title click when you finish is one of my favorite things in the world. I came, I saw, I cried, I laughed, I conquered. I am overall very happy with this book, and I think you all will be too <3 me getting this ARC was definitely the highlight of my life and I can now go to bed happy. "
51,1,Reminders of Him,Colleen Hoover,51,2022-01-26,Arini,3,"3.25 StarsOh my, Mother of Traumatizing Calamity! Ironically, this is the ✨BLANDEST✨ CoHo’s ever been.First of all, CoHo should’ve made this into a THRILLER cause I think the premise would make for a better romantic suspense than whatever this ended up being. Alas, this book showed that the Queen did indeed MISS once in a while. 🤷‍♀️Second, it’s only the first month of 2022, and here’s CoHo wreaking havoc on my heart with another one of her tragedies. Again. 😢 And this time, she even managed to drag COLDPLAY into it. What a travesty! 😒Third, seriously though, this woman has an unhealthy fascination with ‘dramatic’ accidents and car wrecks. Her books should be the poster child for road traffic safety or automobile/home insurance company. 💀🚘
Kenna Rowan is an ex-con who served her five year sentence in prison for involuntary manslaughter of her then still alive boyfriend. Upon discharging, she’s looking to start over and reconnect with the daughter she carried and birthed during her serving time but never had the chance to hold.The romance comes in when she meets ex-football player and current bar owner, Ledger Ward, whom she immediately feels mutual attraction to. Unfortunately, ✦bad timing✦ and any hope of pursuing anything more is quickly dashed when they find out who the other person really is.Ledger is Kenna’s dead boyfriend’s (Scotty) best friend who’s been taking care of her daughter along with Scotty’s parents.
It’s not CoHo if it isn’t full of painful truths. This book explores how unfair the world is towards ex-felons, especially female ones, and the challenges they face in navigating life after prison. It also highlights how powerless they are, especially those who also happen to be mothers. I didn’t outrightly cry, but this book did get me teary eyed.
The Mother/Daughter Reunion
I don’t think this part is handled particularly well. Not that it didn’t break my heart seeing Kenna’s longing for her child and her struggle as well as desperation to see her. However, I’m disappointed that Kenna didn’t try harder to fight for her daughter. Not that there was anything much she could do in her position. But she only tried once, got rejected by the people in her daughter’s life, and was ready to give up. I feel like she should’ve made more plans, taken more steps, be more persistent.I’m disappointed at Kenna’s acceptance and constant understanding of the animosity she received from the people in her daughter’s life. She believed she wasn’t a bad person and hoped for forgiveness and redemption, but she didn’t do much to reach for them. I don’t necessarily want this book to be all about Kenna’s efforts to reunite with her daughter to the point that it overshadowed the romance, but the fact that it sorta was, yet I still found it lacking was most ironically dismaying.
The Romance


“Maybe it doesn’t matter whether something is a coincidence or a sign. Maybe the best way to cope with the loss of the people we love is to find them in as many places and things as we possibly can.”

Idk what to think of the romance. I think it was poorly written. Kenna and Ledger didn’t fall in love under the best of circumstances, but I’m afraid Ledger might just be a consolation prize for Kenna. I’m not sure if Kenna was over her grief and already moved on from her dead boyfriend. Also, the fact that she still wrote him letters, I don’t know what to make of that. I loved that we saw glimpses of their relationship from those letters. At the same time, it only emphasized how much she loved him.By the end of the book, I didn’t feel assured that Ledger was not just a replacement. Not to mention, the dilemma and the guilt they had to deal with because of who Ledger was to her dead boyfriend. Makes me think, what if they’d met when he was still alive? They fell in love because of that one common denominator, but I also wanted to see them fall for each other without that shared grief and pain. I suppose, it served him right cause for a romance H, Ledger sure tasted like unseasoned crackers. 🤪The Accident [SPOILERS!!!]For the majority of the book, I kept waiting for that one mindblowing twist that CoHo is known for, but the fact that THERE’S NOT ONE SINGLE PLOT TWIST (besides Ledger the BFF) is utterly disappointing, disappointingly underwhelming, and very unbecoming of CoHo. It was hard to comprehend and accept that the accident happened because Kenny was being careless and irresponsible. Even when she described it in detail near the end of the book, the logic was somewhat lost on me.How can a person be disastrously stupid? 😫 Not that I’ve ever been in a car crash. I’ve been in a motorbike crash TWICE, but both were minor and I wasn’t the driver. It didn’t feel great, but it didn’t send me into a tailspin of panic the likes of Kenna’s either, so I guess I shouldn’t judge. In any case, somehow I expected the accident to be a misunderstanding. And perhaps, the plot twist would be her dead boyfriend being the driver/the one at fault; hence, Kenna was falsely accused, but she accepted her sentence cause she felt guilty. I mean, wouldn’t that be more epicly plausible???

“Sometimes I wonder if we’re all born with equal amounts of good andevil. What if no one person is more or less malevolent than another, and thatwe all just release our bad at different times, in different ways?”


Closing Thoughts . . .
I suppose the point of all this is to show that no matter how tiny the mistake you make, it can have insurmountable consequences. But it shouldn’t be the only thing that defines you for the rest of your life as long as the path to forgiveness and redemption is open and you’re willing to take the journey (which Kenna kinda did, but it was unconvincing?). 🏃‍♀️Reminders of Him was a tough read, but it didn’t hit as hard as CoHo’s other books. Usually, I’d be deeply affected by her stories no matter that I ended up loving or hating them. This one fell somewhat in the middle. 😪 I think it could’ve benefited from a longer page count. In my opinion, the plot was underdeveloped. The romance was uninspired. The lack of plot twist was THE plot twist itself. 🤯 The ending was rushed and wrapped up too neatly. The side characters were more interesting than the MCs. The pacing felt off.Overall, it was an emotional read that made my eyes water, but ultimately it read like a typical women’s fiction (that was evidently “CoHo,” but didn’t bear her special trademark). I don’t think this is a must read for CoHo fans, but if you have FOMO, then I suggest don’t come in with high expectations. Maybe then you’d appreciate the book more than I did. ✋

Still thinking about this book till this day 05/06/2022!! Colleen Hoover still owes me boxes of tissues😪!!!! ""Is that a fucking pigeon"". Every time this quote came up in the book it just made me laugh so much I cried!!!OH MY GOSH!!! This book was so heart wrenching!!!! Reminders of Him by Colleen Hoover was beautifully written, but yet so heartbreaking. The amount of tissues I went through was unbelievable. Thank you Colleen for leaving me so empty, the amount of tears I shed was insane! I cried my eyes out like there was no tomorrow! Once I started this book I couldn't put it down. This will be a story that stays with me forever. I cried, I cheered for Kenna, I cheered for Ledger. I was one ugly sobbing mess. If you have never read a book by Colleen Hoover before, you will never know the pain that goes along with reading her books. My heart was broken, my eyes were red and puffy from crying while reading this amazing story. Colleen you owe me a couple boxes of tissues😭💔!!!A troubled young mother yearns for a shot at redemption in this heartbreaking yet hopeful novel by Colleen Hoover. Kenna, Diem, and Ledger will be in my heart for a long time to come. I would love a sequel of this book as Diem's POV after meeting Kenna. After serving five years in prison for a tragic mistake, Kenna Rowan returns to the town where it all went wrong, hoping to reunite with her four year old daughter, Diem. Kenna and her boyfriend Scotty were driving to the lake one night from a party when Kenna and Scotty were both too drunk and too high to drive. But Kenna chose to get behind the wheel anyways. Kenna and Scotty were on a deserted gravel country road when Kenna was speeding and lost control of their car and left Scotty to die. In the time Kenna was looking for help she didn't know Scotty was still alive until the next morning when the police showed up at her apartment and arrested her. At the time of Kenna's trial, she didn't know she was pregnant, otherwise she wouldn't have pleaded guilty. Diem was born a preemie and was handed into the arms of her grandparents, Scotty's family. Kenna lost anything to do with her daughter while she was serving her time, she couldn't even hold Diem the minute she was born. But the bridges Kenna burned are proving impossible to rebuild. Everyone in her daughter's life is determined to shut Kenna out, no matter how hard she proves herself. The only person who hasn't closed the door on Kenna completely is Ledger Ward, a local bar owner and one of the few remaining links to Kenna's daughter. Ledger was Scotty were best friends but Kenna never met him before Scotty's death. But if anyone were to discover how Ledger is slowly becoming an important part of Kenna’s life, both would risk losing the trust of everyone important to them. The two form a connection despite the pressure surrounding them, but as their romance grows, so does the risk. Kenna must find a way to absolve the mistakes of her past in order to build a future out of hope and healing. The letters Kenna wrote Scotty destroyed me😭💔!!!!"
54,1,Reminders of Him,Colleen Hoover,54,2022-01-22,Destiny Sidwell,5,i’m ugly crying in my bed because this story was so heartbreakingly beautiful! my fav coho book ever! a piece of my heart will forever be stuck in these pages! 💕
55,1,Reminders of Him,Colleen Hoover,55,2022-12-16,Kat,1,"UPDATE: despite EVERYTHING this book made it to the final round of the Goodreads Choice Awards; we really do be living in a society... 🤡______________The only person I would finish this book for is my dog... if you held him at gunpoint.It's been some time since I wrote one of my rant reviews and I know some of my mutuals think them peak entertainment so here we goooooo: Reminders of Him was a book so not to my liking that I DNF-ed after the first few chapters (I literally NEVER DNF, like EVER). This was my first ever CoHo book and boy, if I had known what burning dumpster-fire of reeking red flags had awaited me...Synopsis: After serving five years in prison for a tragic mistake, Kenna Rowan returns to the town where it all went wrong, hoping to reunite with her four-year-old daughter. But the bridges Kenna burned are proving impossible to rebuild. Everyone in her daughter’s life is determined to shut Kenna out, no matter how hard she works to prove herself. The only person who hasn’t closed the door on her completely is Ledger Ward, a local bar owner and one of the few remaining links to Kenna’s daughter. But if anyone were to discover how Ledger is slowly becoming an important part of Kenna’s life, both would risk losing the trust of everyone important to them.Alright, I thought to myself. That doesn't sound too bad. This could be a solid story. And the first chapter was alright. We learn that Kenna is a 27-year-old mother who was sent to prison because of a deadly car accident involving her then boyfriend Scotty. She was pregnant at the time and gave birth to her daughter in prison. Now she's back in Scotty's home-town and the first thing she does is seek out the bookshop she used to frequent with him. Only that the bookshop is now a bar owned by, guess who??? Yep, you got it! Her ex's former best friend, Ledger!Queue Ledger's POV who pulls his truck into the alley behind his bar only to notice that one of his fingernails is still painted from when he played dress-up with his four-year-old the previous night. Hmmmmmm, Kenna's daughter is the same age.Now, we have Kenna walking into the bar who is so naturally stunning and pretty, the second Ledger lays his eyes on her he ""overfill[s] the glasses and water goes everywhere"". Listen, love-at-first-sight might be some people's favourite trope but it sure as hell isn't mine. Reading that gave me second-hand embarrassment. Where is the build-up? The romantic tension? You want me to root for these two dumb-asses but then give me nothing to root for because they're in love the second they meet??Switch to Kenna's POV who writes a therapeutic letter to Scotty, telling him that she kissed a prison guard once, and that ""it had been two years since [she] had been touched by [Scotty], so when he pressed [her] against the wall and gripped [her] waist, [she] thought [she]'d feel more.""Yeah, bestie, uh uh, we're not doing this. Back to jail.But let's move on to Ledger who's 
""good looking in a way that a girl who is trying to get custody of her daughter should want to stay away from"".
 A lot of words and I still don't know what he looks like. Oh wait, ""he's got eyes that have seen a thing or two, and hands that have probably hit a man or two."" So I'm guessing he looks like this??Ledger, on the other hand, who just met this woman, who's known her for all but 20 minutes, is sure that Kenna's face is ""a work of art"" and god, how he wishes ""there was a picture of it hanging on a wall in a museum somewhere so [he] could stand in front of it and stare at it for as long as [he] wanted."" Not the ""face is a painting and belongs in museum"" trope, I beg thee. 😭When their fingers touch for the first time Ledger obviously feels like there's ""an erupting volcano"" trapped in his chest. What else could it be? When two straight people of the opposite gender touch each other and there are no sparks, it wouldn't be a romance novel, would it?Kenna leaves the bar though not without having Ledger run after her to tell her to come back that night. My fellow readers. You have one guess: Does the main protagonist heed the summons of a man she barely knows to return to his bar at closing time, when she'd be the only one there? Of course, she does. All she can concentrate on when she's back is how often he points at things. 
""Two guys get into an argument, but he doesn’t care—he just points to the door and they leave. He does that a lot. Points at things, and people just do the things he points out for them to do. He points at two customers while making eye contact with the other bartender. That bartender walks up to them and closes out their tabs.""
When she is about to leave and he motions her to sit back down again all she can think of is that ""[she] had no idea pointing was sexy."" GURRRRLLL, I know you spent the last five years in prison but surely you can't be THAT DESPERATE for some D???But hold on, that wasn't even the best-worst line because that was undoubtedly: ""He touches his hair now, pushing it back, staring down at me. There’s a war in his eyes, and I am by no means Switzerland, but he comes to me anyway."" Ayoooooooo??!! 😩😭Anyway, Kenna rightly decides that ""talking will only get [her] into trouble"" but what does she do instead? She slides onto his lap and immediately starts making out with him. Yes, our girl IS that desperate. Straight romances, I swear???There sure is and it's getting bigger with every straight romance book."
56,1,Reminders of Him,Colleen Hoover,56,2022-02-08,Tina,3,"I think this is one that will go down as more enjoyable because I listened to it. I always love the Brittany Pressley and Ryan West duo combo narration. Had I read this one I don't think it would have captured much of my attention. This is my third Colleen Hoover book. She's a good storyteller but in this particular one I was not quite feeling the characters or the romance aspect. Kenna, has been in prison for 5 years for a terrible accident. Her child has been in the care of her grandparents. Upon her release she is determined to get her daughter back and make an amends.I was frustrated with the characters and part of the story but I did feel Kenna's helplessness. It's an emotional story but yet did not fully grab me. The romance was minimal and I did not feel the magic with the couple. I was happy with the overall ending."
57,1,Reminders of Him,Colleen Hoover,57,2022-02-01,Regina,None,"Did not finish. No rating.When you typically burn through a Colleen Hoover book in one sitting, but you can only force yourself to read a chapter or two of her latest each night, you know it's time to move on. Many readers are loving this one, so please do check out the other reviews if you're a CoHo fan. I just found the first-person telling-not-showing writing and the insta-smash relationship to be so utterly off-putting that I started to resent every minute I spent with these characters. Perhaps I've just outgrown this author. What a drag!"
58,1,Reminders of Him,Colleen Hoover,58,2020-02-29,Cardan Greenbriar,None," HI, HELLO CAN THIS PLEASE BE A TRAUMATIZER LIKE VERITY?!"
59,1,Reminders of Him,Colleen Hoover,59,2022-01-26,Susanne,2,"Unfortunately, Reminders of Him simply didn’t resonate with me. I kind of feel like I read a different book than everyone else as I didn’t connect with the storyline or the characters. I couldn’t help but roll my eyes throughout and felt that the entire book was OTT. This is perhaps only the second book of COHO’s that I didn’t care for. It is what it is. I’m only one reader so I think it’s clearly a case of me being the wrong reader for this novel. Published on Goodreads. "
60,2,It Starts with Us,Colleen Hoover,60,2022-11-22,elle,1,"welcome to: “did this book really need to exist?” part 4343225.alternatively titled: a bland man does the bare minimum and people eat it up like he’s an austen character.i swore i’d never read another coho book, but it ends with us was the only one i could somewhat stomach so i decided to read it starts with us to see how it was.yikes.this review will be in bullet points. minor spoilers will be included, but read it anyway as a warning not to read this book.edit: for those of you in my comments going “if you don’t have anything nice to say don’t say it at all!”: we’re allowed to critically consume literature? i’m allowed to write a glowing review of one book and a critical review of another. that’s why this is a book reviewing site.like if you can’t handle seeing a one star review or acknowledging that people have different opinions, then don’t read one star reviews! there are thousands of five star ones you can read. go read those instead literally nobody is making you read this lmao.• i don’t get why this book had to exist. it just feels like she is monetizing off the weird success it ends with us got on booktok, and it definitely reads like a cash grab as well.• if it ends with us was about lily, why did colleen hoover work so hard to try and make atlas into a sexy hero? the only thing i could give it ends with us merit for was the message of breaking the cycle (even that is up for debate). this did not need a sequel at all.• atlas is literally so bland. like i get it. he’s nice. he makes sure to say that he’d never hit a woman every five sentences. good fucking job atlas. you’ve reached the bare minimum.• atlas writing lily letters and saying “i love you” in a thousand different ways to offset ryle’s character…balance doesn’t work like that.• speaking of: stop writing her letters for the love of god i literally don’t know if my heart is cold and dead but we get it atlas, you love her and can’t live without her and she saved you. you don’t have to say it a hundred times!! what a waste of paper!!! give us some new content king!• WHY IS LILY STILL WRITING TO ELLEN??? AT YOUR BIG AGE?• atlas talking and defending himself about the age he and lily had sex was really breaking the fourth wall. coho definitely was trying to un-fuck up her mistake by making this a sympathy point.• lily and atlas didn’t really have a foundation of their relationship (which is ironic because atlas talks about ryle and lily’s relationship this way as well) other than the fact that they both had a bad childhood. lily puts atlas on this pedestal because he was there for her at her most vulnerable.• my theory still stands: colleen hoover, ironically, cannot write a good romance. i believe every single one of her books has these terrible, wild plot twists to cover up the fact that she cannot. lily and atlas had zero chemistry apart from them talking about how miserable they were when they first met and how they were each other’s saving grace.• also. i did not buy this book, i borrowed it from a friend, so i don’t have a ground to say this but: she included so many flashbacks and used pages of writing from it ends with us? lower the price girl.• a sequel, which is an outright romance, being written to a book (marketed as a romance which is so gross) about domestic abuse really throws me off.• (the letters were basically coho saying “see they are in love! they’re not bland! they do have other things in common other than their trauma!) which is false.• speaking of plot points manufactured to make lily and atlas seem like they had more in common: the brother thing came out of fucking nowhere. • lily doesn’t have a decent support system. i know she says that she does, but having your abusive ex husband’s sister as your best friend (and literally only her, as lily mentions in the book), is just not? like yes it’s better than nothing but i really hated the way allysa acted in a bunch of scenes. like is she supposed to be a likable character?• also. every time tiktok is mentioned in a book, an angel loses its wings. you're telling me lily knows about tiktok and gen z but she doesn't know that ellen is a horrible person? ok• emerson dory kincaid is literally the worst thing lily blossom bloom has done.in conclusion, sometimes you try things and they don’t work out colleen! for me it is ice skating, for you it is writing. and that’s ok!——————————————————instagram: ellereadsomebooks"
61,2,It Starts with Us,Colleen Hoover,61,2022-10-25,Tish,5,"5 stars Let me start by saying this: there’s going to be a lot of hate for this book for the sole reason people just want to dislike this author for their popularity and there’s this hate train going on for the littlest things this author does so I already know people are going to just come out of the woodworks and find the tiniest thing to hate on this. That is not to say that this book is perfect or that your review will be disingenuous. Books are subjective-- therefore there can be books that I love you hate, and books I hate that you love. I just don't understand or stand for the unwarranted amount of hate that goes into BASHING books just for the way they are written. I have been reading Colleen Hoover since 2012- Slammed was my first book by her. I have had many misses with her along with many hits. With that being said; I read It Ends With Us in 2016. I truly loved how it ended, I thought it was the end. I did not ever expect it starts with us and yet I could not think of what a beautiful and necessary addition this is.It Starts with Us shows the after effects of abuse in every form. It shows how realistic, how tragic and how even a happily ever after is still shadowed by the ache and reminder of abuse. I know people are going to be mad at how often Ryle shows up here but that’s the reality of how abusive situations are, they don’t just die or leave you alone— colleen did a fantastic job at showing how realistic this situation is, at how much of a gaslighter he is.For the Ryle apologist and stans: I’m so glad Colleen wrote this book because there’s NO room for y’all’s bullshit. He is an abuser. This isn’t a dark romance. This is a contemporary romance where an abuser stays abusive, continues to be abusive in the tiniest ways and the cycles are broken. He truly and will forever be a terrible person and I’m so glad that this book continuously highlighted that. Abusers don’t “change” and even if they do, the cycle should be broken forever. We get to see Lily and Atlas as an unit and we get to see them really fall in love with their love. I so deeply appreciated that aspect. We really do get to see them find their way back to each other and then fight for their love. This is THEIR story now. I also want to add, I loved the side characters. Every single one of them. Theo and Josh stole my goddamn heart. The only thing I rolled my eyes at was Lily writing to Ellen still but alas a book can’t be too perfect. Atlas has always been book boyfriend material but this book really cemented him as one of the good guys, and if not one of the top 10 book boyfriend’s in existence. I was not expecting this to get 5 stars from me, my favorite book by Colleen Hoover is Reminders of Him but this really deserves five stars for how thoughtful, realistic and just downright beautiful this was. It ends with us was about Lily and her journey to end the cycle of abuse. It starts with Us is about Lily and Atlas navigating life after ending their own cycles. We’ve reached the shores turned into You can come home now."
62,2,It Starts with Us,Colleen Hoover,62,2022-11-12,Yun,3,"I don't dislike It Starts with Us per se, but it does feel more like a long and unnecessary epilogue to It Ends with Us rather than the separate, worthwhile story it should've been.I remember vividly the experience of reading It Ends with Us, how every page felt riveting and every moment essential. There were so many memorable scenes, so much emotion embedded in the pages. I sobbed my way through it, especially that ending that completely gutted me. To prep for this book, I reread the ending, and sure enough, it walloped me again.So it's rather disappointing that this story didn't do anything for me. There was no emotional punch, no compelling conflict. It took me days longer to read this than I anticipated because I didn't feel any pull to keep going. And now having finished this, I'm already unable to point to a single memorable moment because there honestly weren't any.But then, that's always the fear when an author gives in to fans and writes a sequel or prequel they originally had no intention of writing, isn't it? That the result would be mundane, at best an unnecessary add-on, at worst ruining the legacy of a previously amazing work. (I'm looking at you, Harry Potter and The Hunger Games.)More spelled out isn't always better. Whatever I had imagined in my head for Lily's future, it was more interesting than what I got. And in fact, to spell out Lily's future in the way that this sequel did took something away from the difficulty of Lily's decision at the end of the first book. Part of what I loved about that book was the nuanced and flawed characters, while this book distilled everyone down to either just a good guy or a bad guy.The other issue is that there is no real conflict or surprises in here. Sure, I enjoy reading a happy ending as much as the next person, but not for 300+ pages. It's clear without having read a single page of this book what will happen and who will end up happy. And sure enough, the story progresses and ends exactly the way you'd expect. And that just does not make for an enthralling read.This all sounds rather harsh, but it's really not that bad. It was an alright way to pass a few hours if you're not quite ready to leave the world of Lily and Atlas. This pleasant and unexciting story won't leave you breathless, but it shouldn't offend either. Just be ready to forget about it almost as soon as you're done.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:It Ends with UsVerityReminders of HimRegretting YouUgly Love Layla ~~~~~~~~~~~~"
63,2,It Starts with Us,Colleen Hoover,63,2022-10-30,trina (ryke meadows wife),2,"2.5⭐️If you love Atlas individually or Lily and Atlas as a couple, this is the book for you, you’d love this. However, I don’t feel like a sequel was necessary. The ending in It Ends with Us was perfect! It left us to imagine our own ending for Lily and it was realistic! This book was strictly written for Booktok. This doesn’t happen in real life. Women don’t always have a Prince Charming waiting for them after they escape an abusive relationship. This is why these idiots on TikTok are romanticizing this shit, thinking this is some kind of love triangle. Ryle is clearly still ill and it shows in this book?? CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE FUCKING GASLIGHTING HE TRIED TO DO TO LILY?”You won’t leave her with me overnight, but you’ll drop her off somewhere else when you want to get fucked? Great parenting, Lily.” “You disappoint me Lily.” “ I was happier before I met you.”HOW DARE PEOPLE DEFEND THIS FUCKER? BECAUSE OF HIS TRAUMA? HE KILLED HIS BROTHER AND HAS BEEN BLAMING HIS ANGER ON THAT SHIT EVER SINCE. HE THREW HER DOWN THE STAIRS. HE SLAPPED HER FOR LAUGHING. HE BIT HER. THEN PATCHED HER UP LIKE A CABBAGE PATCH DOLL. OMG. DID NO ONE NOT FIND IT DISTURBING THAT THIS MAN WAS A SURGEON? AFTER HE HURT HER, SHE DIDN’T EVEN HAVE TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL, HE IS THE HOSPITAL. THAT IS SO SCARY. FUCK YOU RYLE AND FUCK WHOEVER IS OBSESSED WITH YOUR TOXIC ASS. So clearly, When I read It Ends with Us, I didn’t care about the romance or Atlas as an individual. Atlas is very likable, but it wasn’t about that for me. I was more invested in Lily’s healing process and her story, I still felt that way going into this book. I truly just wanted to read this to see if Ryle would end up in fucking prison. I wanted to see if he was still wreaking havoc. Maybe I thought in this book, Ryle would acknowledge he’s a fucking monster and he’d watch Lily flourish happily from the sidelines. I couldn’t wait for the moment Lily stood up to him, that’s all I was looking forward to. I was only emotional for those parts specifically, I really don’t care about Atlas and Lily y’all. Theo making fun of Atlas was funny, I actually loved that because THE KEEP SWIMMING LINE WAS CORNY AS SHIT I DON’T CARE   “We finally reached the beach, my little whale.”   LMFAOOOO I wasn’t fond of the diary entries to Ellen in the first book and I especially didn’t like them here. It was cute when she was younger, but we’re grown folks now Lily. Ellen is not reading that shit, cut it out. Anyway, this was mid. Lily was too damn kind. Call me bitter, but if it were me, I’d leave Ryle to rot in hell and not let that man anywhere near my child.↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓My review before reading this:  Few more days, it ends with us isnt my fav by her, but I’m pretty excited to read this!"
64,2,It Starts with Us,Colleen Hoover,64,2022-10-19,Mareeva,2,"2.5 starsWell this was useless.It Starts With Us in a nutshell:
15%
 of this book is a retelling of the first one through Lily's creepy letters to Ellen. Literally reused, word for word scenes. Was Colleen tryna reach a word count or smth?
35%
 is the vandalisation/secret brother subplot which I desperately wished was Ryle's doing💀 imagine grown ass Ryle writing ""ass whole"" and ""fuck u Atlass"" as petty revenge. Because y'all know he is a wife beater with a sense of humour...Ryle after another day of abusing and manipulating:

You disappoint me Lily.

This is the opening line his drunk ass choose to text after having lily in a chokehold💀 why he is so extraMy biggest highlight of the whole read is TJ saying this😭Also Ryle three paragraphs later:

have fun fucking the homeless guy.

Can y'all believe it took them THIS long to send that man to therapy?Anyway, the tiny bit of 
5%
 is Ryle being Ryle.....clearly🡹💀and the other 
45%
 is Lily and Atlas's dry ass hehe romance.The first book was good for what it was. A story about domestic violence and abusive relationships. Ryle was the spine, without his character there would be nothing except another boring coho romance. Which is essentially what this book was. I will admit, I thought the secret brother plotline was interesting, but it wasn't nearly enough to keep my attention until the end. It Ends With Us had a purpose, a meaning, a story to tell. This didn't.[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>"

80,2,It Starts with Us,Colleen Hoover,80,2022-10-18,Phuong ✯,2,"– 2.25 stars This book was not necessary and clearly fan service for BookTok. Colleen even said that herself in the Acknowledgement section. I’ve read It Ends with Us years ago and that book made me bawl my eyes out, because it was such an honest and realistic story about a women finally ending the circle of abuse in her family. IEWU had a purpose and meaning. Whereas, It Starts With Us reads like every other second-chance romance between two past lovers that shared a connection in their childhood. Reading Lily and Atlas romance gave me n o t h i n g. This was dryer than any cactus in the dept of the Sahara. Their interactions made me yawn, I’m sorry but Atlas was better as a side character in IEWU. Atlas is (maybe) the most unproblematic Colleen Hoover Hero, but imo that also makes him the most boring one. 
“I don’t have a picture of her,” I say to Theo. ”So she’s ugly?” I toss the box of glass into the dumpster. “She’s gorgeous and way out of my league.””Ugly would still be out of your league,” he deadpans.
 12 year old Theo who talked like he was going on 50 was my favorite character in this book. And you know why? Because this little kid was pretty much bullying Atlas every time they interacted and I loved it. Some adults should be bullied more. 💅
You disappoint me Lily.I was happier before I met you.Have fun fucking the homeless guy.
Y’all can say anything nasty about Ryle and I would completely agree, but you also have to admit that this guy is nothing but ✨ consistent ✨ in his abusive behavior. My face was this 😐 emoji the whole time, except when it came to Ryle, cause at least that guy gave me some emotions.. his texts to Lily even made me laugh… Lily, sweetie I’m sorry but your ex-husband humor is immaculate 🤡🏃🏻‍♀️ Ryle kept me on my toes, cause I never knew what else would come out of his mouth or what would happen at the mercy of his fist. What an unpredictable king. 😌
There is this toxic belief that family should stick together simply because they’re family. But the best thing I ever did for myself was walk away from them.
ConclusionIt Ends With Us should have stayed a standalone. It had the perfect bittersweet ending that was on point with the whole book. This was just meh and didn’t add anything interesting or new to the overall story. ┍━━━━━━━━»•» «•«━┑

81,2,It Starts with Us,Colleen Hoover,81,2022-10-21,ZOË,1,"1.5In short, ‘It Starts With Us’ is nothing but an extended epilogue that could’ve been a bonus chapter. Everything about this book annoyed me; from lack of plot and bland characters, to commentary devoid of nuance and whole sections of the first book copied and pasted into the text. Something smells like a cash grab…I’ll admit; the discussion around abuse in this book wasn’t AS bad as in ‘It Ends With Us’, but it still felt pretty one dimensional and pissed me off at times. I can’t for the life of me understand why this series is hailed as one about ending the cycle of abuse, since the cycle of abuse in the books doesn’t even end! SPOILERSI understand that it would be very hard for Lily to win over Ryle in court, and the ending was probably more realistic with him still being involved; but if that’s the case, it doesn’t “end” with you and your daughter! If Ryle doesn’t have Lily in his life to abuse, guess who his next victim is going to be?Not to mention the fact that Lily’s closest friends are Ryle’s sister and his best friend; it is close to impossible to heal from abuse when you are still in such close proximity to your abuser. The way Allysa and Marshall talk about Ryle as if he’s a little kid who just gets mean sometimes, instead of the violent wife beater and attempted rapist that he is, is so strange…. Maybe I’m the weird one, but if someone I “love like a brother” were to push their partner down the stairs and bite them so hard they bled, I simply wouldn’t love them like a brother anymore!Allysa in particular was extremely annoying in this book. “Why would Ryle hate Atlas if you didn’t cheat on him 🥺🥺” idk girl maybe it’s because he’s abusive, which you have known for years now! The whole “me cheating on my husband doesn’t count because I was 19 ✨” thing was also???????????Idk man. Everyone in every Colleen Hoover book sends off massive alarm bells in my brain. “Problematic” aspects aside; ‘It Starts With Us’ was just plain bad a lot of the time. I feel bad for anyone who was looking forward to seeing Atlas’ perspective since he has about as much depth as a paper plate. We get it; Lily saved his life and he loves her! Fascinating. Now stop talking about it every 30 seconds and grow an actual personality, for the love of God! Pages of love letters and wedding vows don’t make up for an absence of depth, and certainly not lack of banter and attraction between characters.I don’t know if CoHo needs to go back to school or something, but there’s a biiiiiig difference between history and chemistry, and our main characters are missing the latter. News flash! Trauma bonding doesn’t mean you’re soulmates!! These people need therapy, not each other. I honestly think the story would’ve been more powerful had Atlas and Lily just been friends. Love cannot cure the trauma of an abusive relationship, no matter how strong it is. Rapid fire nitpicks from yours truly include; Ellen Degeneres, confusing time jumps, this being categorized as romance, the fact that only Atlas’ wedding vows were shown, and Emerson Dory being named Emerson Dory!Do yourself a good old favor and don’t waste your time and money on this ❤️"

88,2,It Starts with Us,Colleen Hoover,88,2022-06-21,Isabella,1,This feels like nothing more than a cash grab. Atlas is a bare minimum decent human being (who slept with an underage girl) and doesn’t need to outshine the story of domestic abuse and survival like the last book portrayed.

90,3,Love on the Brain,Ali Hazelwood,90,2022-10-22,Kat,1,"Before we get into Love On the Brain, I would like to take a second and remind everyone that I gave The Love Hypothesis 5 whole stars LESS THAN A YEAR AGO. I bring that up because my thoughts here are going to be undeniably ranty and I want to re-establish the fact that I have not been, like, hate-reading Ali Hazelwood from the start. I wanted to love her sophomore novel, but this was one of the most mind-numbing/soul-crushing/coochie-drying experiences of my life and I have to speak my truth.Here’s the short version: Everything TLH is, LOTB is, but more. If you liked the former, maybe consider giving this one a try. Just know you will be reading the same thing twice (five times if we count the novellas). At this point, it’s clear that Hazelwood is not going to take the initiative to break her own mold. Is she unwilling or incapable? Couldn’t say, but I can tell you her books are suffering as a result. So, if you don’t want to feel like you’re on a never-ending merry-go-round of science puns and quirk, pick one of her titles and go with it, then get off the ride while you still can.Now, onto a more substantial review.Bee might have purple hair and her own version of a PSL-obsession (Marie Curie, anyone?? Haven’t heard of her? Well, you’re about to), but she is Olive. Levi may have a slightly altered past trauma that causes him to come across as cold and unyielding, but he is Adam. She’s petite, so very teensy, just an itty bitty little dust speck. He’s tall tall tall, with Big Boy muscles and the penis of a goddamn stallion. She’s funky! Loves science! He is strong and silent, but also <3 <3 <3 science!!! It’s tedious. If I wanted to reread The Love Hypothesis, I’d simply do it and save myself the headache that comes along with this level of deja vu.The first time I read Ali Hazelwood’s rendition of “enemies” to lovers, I thought it was cute. Now I’m fed up. You’re telling me that an adult man, who leads teams of people and is smart enough to launch rockets (or some other equally impressive space shit), cannot physically STAND to be in the same room as the girl he thinks is pretty? Say what you will about Joshua Templeman, but that man toiled feet away from the woman he fake-hated for months on end without issue. Levi, on the other hand, acts repulsed by Bee’s existence and cowers from her touch, then has the audacity to be shocked when his feelings toward her are questioned. Get a grip and grow the fuck up, my guy. She may be a neuroscientist, but she cannot read your mind. And as much as I love shit-talking fictional men, we can’t exclude Bee from the blame. Miscommunication is one thing, but there’s something so juvenile about the brand of confusion struck up between the couples in this universe. If I had a nickel for every time one of Ali’s protagonists decided to operate based solely on presumed slights and imagined beef, I’d have 25 cents—which isn’t a lot, but it’s weird that it has happened five times. Despite not being a Science Bitch (after almost flunking chemistry in high school I never looked back), I am all for writing about women in STEM. I can appreciate Hazelwood’s passion for the topics she includes in her books and the importance of writing characters who are equally excited about them. I also respect her highlighting of issues that plague the field. However, if major twists in your book can be clocked by a dumbass like me at 4%, because you’ve used them before, that's maybe a sign to re-evaluate your process. And, while we’re talking STEM rep—I’m no expert, but every time a female MC experiences sexism in the workplace, is it really the ‘STEMinist’ move to have her man be the one to swoop in and immediately fix everything for her? The sex. God, it pains me to say this. Up until now, I have been relatively impressed with how Hazelwood writes intimacy. Even the novellas, which were disappointing in almost every way, brought some smut to the table that I thought was worth reading. Someone involved is usually less experienced, but it’s not always the woman and it’s never a big deal. There’s mentions of awkwardness and anxiety, shit that may not be HOT, but are realistic in vulnerable moments. Alas, all that flies out the window with LOTB. As if the book gods knew I was going to be scrounging for crumbs to praise here and wanted one last laugh, but I digress. I’m not ashamed to say, I was jazzed when I heard this story had three sex scenes to TLH’s one. Now I know better. Ali, m’am, I’ve done nothing but love you, yet you subject me to “he traces the bulge of his cock through the skin of my cheek…” FOR WHAT. I had to read about how Bee is “...some kind of fantasy…built to do this…built for [Levi].” At 28 y/o, she sleeps in a twin bed and is able to fit into clothes from middle school. Her vagina is so small & tight (and hairless! she has gotten her “...chuncha fully waxed every month for years…”) that she nearly blacks out trying to fit Levi’s monster dick inside for the first time. I won’t pretend that these characteristics are unique to Hazelwood’s romances, nor were they entirely exempt from her previous works. But, like I said at the start of this review: LOTB ratchets everything up about a million notches. The objectification and infantilization of Bee made me, quite frankly, uncomfortable. It's shoved down the reader's throat in a way that can't be escaped. Maybe TLH wasn’t the sexiest thing in the world, but Chapter 16 would never hurt me like this book did, that I know for sure. That ending. Not sure who gave it the green light, but what NONSENSE. To be fair, the last 15% of the plot poses the least cause for concern within this whole mess. I just thought I’d mention it’s very “I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren’t for you meddling kids!” and that far too much rides on the existence of a believed-to-be-nonexistent cat. I could also bring up how quickly and conveniently everything was resolved, but I’m too busy reveling in my reaching of the final page to care atm, so I’ll let it go.Let’s end things with the one silver lining I can think of: I read an ARC. An ARC, which I’ve had since January, I think? Meaning, Love On the Brain will have definitely undergone editing between the version I’m talking about and what is released at the end of August, or at least it should’ve (Berkeley, if you’re reading this, you’ve got some typos to fix). Anyway, it'll be different in its final form. Maybe even better? Unfortunately, I’ll never know. I’d rather express Schrödinger's anal glands by hand than have to re-experience this book, albeit in a final copy, but I really hope it is…for all of your sakes."
91,3,Love on the Brain,Ali Hazelwood,91,2022-08-24,emma,2,"At my core, I am a hater.There are many things that seem to fly in the face of this fact (alliteration): My penchant for alliteration and physical inability to not call it out, for one. My deep and profound love of sweet treats and baked goods, which seems characteristic of, like, a small child, or maybe Santa, two figures on the nice end of the optimism scale. My tendency to list vaguely positive things about me.But in truth, I have a hard heart and a mean spirit. I don't WANT to be this way. I love loving things! I reread all the time! I've seen About Time more times than I can count, or is reasonably healthy for me based on a variety of surveys and mental health checklists!And so I beat on, a boat against the current, borne back ceaselessly as I try nonstop to find a new favorite romance novel or discover an auto-buy author.Which is why I was so damn excited by The Love Hypothesis. A book that made me...feel things??? Things that weren't rage and masochistic tendencies and a desire to throw a book-shaped object at a wall???A miracle.But, sadly, folks...it appears this miracle is of the fool's gold variety. Or that very annoying musical that my high school did my junior year about fake water coming from a fake rock. (Or maybe both were real but the phenomenon was fake? I don't know. I tuned it out. My brain is too perfect for musical theater. It'd be like a grain of sand in a microchip to let that sh*t in there.)Anyway. I thought Ali Hazelwood was a new auto-buy author for me. But it appears she may be...the opposite. Whatever that is.This just wasn't it, chief!When an author writes a debut novel, you're like. Fun! New! Surely not everything will be like this forever, and in fact this is a nice dose of fresh content, and not an eternal curse or plague of some kind, following me forever and dooming me to a life of making my wrists hurt via the cosmic punishment of typing out a rant review!But alas. Twas not to be with The Love Hypothesis.Because now everygoddamnromancenovelis The Love Hypothesis.Folks, we have been banished to a small eternity in the hellscape that is Huge Man, Tiny Woman.I hate the ""man so huge he take up big chair he make normal thing look little in massive hand he large and strong"" trope almost as much as I hate ""I am so tiny and cute like a little child <3"" Ali Hazelwood books cannot function for more than two consecutive paragraphs without inserting both. Add a sh*t-eating determination to make every love interest Dark And Broody And Boring And In Love Quietly For Years with their quirky, colorful-haired, deeply immature and at best adolescent (but really toddler-esque) counterparts...Well, call the reality TV smash hit and hotel rerun darling Shark Tank, because I am out!There is something that is to me very disturbing about this dynamic. It's giving: father/daughter. It's giving: gross-out. It's giving: I'm going to be sick.I am a tall woman, and I don't like dating super-tall and extremely toned men, and so there is no room for me here! I am also a woman with a normal personality, a Roth IRA, and a general ability to take care of my f*cking self, so a weird huge tree man looming in the corner creeping on me for years in order to protect my quirky and so random manic pixie dream girl personality...sounds like a real impediment to my life.Add to this fact that we have to spend the end of this book allowing the author to delude herself into thinking that she can write action sequences, and also that that is in any way what we are here for...It's a true NOPE from me.I did not realize I had this much hate in me. Probably at one point I didn't. When I first read this, I could see the fun in a man being obsessed with an unknowing woman from afar until she notices him after several years of pining, or appreciate the silliness and idealization and romanticization, and look past how dumb our protagonist is, and ignore that the only character I really liked was a flat background extra whose only personality is being scary and mean (much like myself), and pretend that ENDING never HAPPENED...But then five months passed as I awaited the release date.And I read three godawful novellas in that time.And I didn't forget a single thing about this book.And not in the good way, either.Bottom line: A life of hatred it is!---------------currently-reading updatesI GOT AN E-ARC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i am never going to shut up about this ever again.---------------tbr reviewali hazelwood wrote one book and in exchange received my undying loyalty"
92,3,Love on the Brain,Ali Hazelwood,92,2023-02-11,Nilufer Ozmekik,5,"Happy pub day 🥳I start my review by giving a big applause for the brilliant person who created this amazing cover! And second one comes for brilliant brain cells of the author! This is absolutely sweetest, quirkiest, smartest, geekiest, sexiest and STEMinest romance I’ve ever read!  Marie Curie fan girl, devoted Jedi, purple haired, ultra smart Bee Königswasser and her nemeses, brooding, know-it-all, reserved Levi Ward who has greenest hypnotizing eyes and their fiery, explosive chemistry hook me up! I loved them so much! Enemies to lovers and friends to lovers themes meet “You’ve got mail” blended in second chances with so much brainy, nerdy references made me giggle at least hundred times!  Heartbroken Bee, who was raised by different relatives, bounced from one extended family member to another, lived in a dozen countries! It’s so normal for her to want a secure, stable life that she can put down roots. She’s opposite of her sister Reike who travels around the world, experiencing different lifestyles.  And Bee thought she’s finally found the love of her life: Tim might be the ONE she can live happily ever after with but she finds out he’s having an affair with her best friend. But now she got a dreamy job offer: she will work at freaking NASA to lead neuroengineering project : she’s going to work on astronaut helmets! Yes! But when she realizes she’s going to work with grad school arch-nemesis Levi Ward: tall, dark haired, piercing green eyes, a brainy Adonis, she curses her luck! And as soon as she arrives at her work space: she finds out she doesn’t have one: because there’s shipment problem about her equipments and clock is ticking, her superiors force her to show them some scientific results about her project, the very same project she cannot start. And Levi still gives her cold shoulder, never returning to her emails, criticizing her fashion style!  She has to confront that man who turns her life into hell by telling him how he makes her feel for years! But what if Levi is not the villain of this story and only thing he wants to do this accomplish their mission by working as equal colleagues. What if Levi’s awkward manners around her doesn’t mean he despises her! Well: I loved the big espionage/ action packed mystery part of the story. Both Levi and Bee were so lovable characters. They keep savoring their happy ending by miscommunication but I loved how their characters evolved!  There are some similarities with Adam and Olive’s story ( Love Hypothesis) : how both couple misunderstands each other, how the hero saves the day and hotel room romance parts! But I liked this formula a lot and this book really burned my brain cells with the smartest references: it’s truly so much fun to live inside Bee’s brain and read her whirlwind thoughts, admire her extra nerdy perspective, her vivid, sarcastic tone! So I’m rounding up 4.5 stars to nerdy, spacey, cat lover, funny, quirky, adorable main characters stars! Special thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for sharing this amazing, one of the most anticipated books’ arc copy with me in exchange my honest thoughts.Looking forward to read upcoming geeky romance stories of Ali Hazelwood."
93,3,Love on the Brain,Ali Hazelwood,93,2022-01-26,Cait Jacobs (Caitsbooks),5,"i might have accidentally read this entire book in one sitting(thank you to Netgalley and Berkley for the eARC!)I can't express how much I adore this book.Love on the Brain is an addictive, adorable, and swoon-worthy read. It took everything I loved in The Love Hypothesis (nerdy and relatable characters, a STEM setting, cute romance, and great banter) and added even more.We follow Bee, a neuroscientist who will be working with NASA on a new project: BLINK. I have to admit, I really loved all of the scientific aspects of this book even more than usual, because BLINK deals with transcranial magnetic stimulation, something I've undergone myself and have never really seen mentioned anywhere else. I might have sent many very excited texts whenever it came up.Okay, but onto what everyone probably wants to hear about the most: the romance. It was so perfect!! Levi is an incredible love interest, and by that I mean I am absolutely in love with him. He and Bee went to the same grad school, where his hatred of Bee was known by everyone, for reasons she never quite understood. So when they're forced to co-lead BLINK, Bee must put aside the past to work towards her future. But of course, not everything is what it seems.Their dynamic was so fun to read, and I just really loved them as a couple. But they aren't the only characters in the book. One character that stole every scene she was in was Rocio, Bee's RA. She was such an entertaining character, I genuinely don't know how to describe her other than the fact that she's iconic.In the end, this book was even better than I could have ever hoped. I can't stop thinking about it, and I can't wait to see what Ali Hazelwood writes next."
94,3,Love on the Brain,Ali Hazelwood,94,2022-07-17,Ayman,4,"4.5 ⭐️ it was giving very much girlboss & male wife energy. i fully believe that ali hazelwood is writing about the same quirky, weird, and loveable female main character and grumpy, buff, and tall af male main character in all of her books. it’s the same shit but different font and you’d think i’d be sick of this shit at this point but i completely devoured this book.both Bee and Levi were enjoyable characters to read about. Bee was funny asf and Levi just made my heart melt in ways i thought were impossible 🫠 his long ass monologues would be something i’d print and frame. the way he was obsessed with Bee made me crumble i fear 😩there were a lot of girlboss moments that i was living for. this book it way more sexier than The Love Hypothesis and i wasn’t fully expecting that and i’m not fucking complaining. i desperately need y’all to listen to me when i say there was something poetic in the way these characters did the devils tango…anyways..hazelwood created lovable characters and a plot i was somewhat invested in. was it kinda predictable? yeah, absolutely. but it was comfortable and warm and fuzzy.the few reasons this book isn’t getting a full 5 stars is because some of the writing did make my eye twitch but i’m not ready to unpack that. o_0thanks to berkeley romance for the ARC"
95,3,Love on the Brain,Ali Hazelwood,95,2023-01-08,Claudia Lomelí,4,"Creo que son 4 estrellas, pero podrían ser 3.5 estrellas.Me gustó mucho Love on the Brain, mi problema fue que sentí que estaba leyendo The Love Hypothesis otra vez, ¡porque es EXACTAMENTE LO MISMO! Hasta los protagonistas son una calca de Adam y Olive (los de TLH), pero dicho esto, una vez que lo entendí y decidí dejarlo pasar, lo disfruté mucho. Supongo que esa es la fórmula de Ali y por ahora me gusta, aunque espero que en futuros libros le cambie un poco. Y no me malentiendan, amo leer a mujeres en STEM, pero hay muchas formas de variar la historia, con el simple hecho de cambiar los tropes ya sería refrescante :).Lo que más amé: A Levi, que me hizo llorar varias veces porque en la vida real no existen hombres así, jajajaja.Lo que menos me gustó: El último 20% del libro. Siento que salió un ""villano"" de la nada y de repente todo se puso MUY FUERTE AND FOR WHAT? Nada que ver con el tono del libro y me sacó de la historia. (Ojo, sí sospechaba del ""villano"", lo que me sacó de onda fue LO QUE LE QUERÍA HACER A BEE, se me hizo muy forzado, como que muy fuera de las vibras del libro)."

98,3,Love on the Brain,Ali Hazelwood,98,2022-01-16,Elena Armas,5,"Y'all are not ready for Levi, the cinnamonest roll of all cinnamon rolls."
99,3,Love on the Brain,Ali Hazelwood,99,2022-08-24,elena ❀  [on hiatus] ,1,"I mean, are we surprised?I truly did think this would have potential. But, I could tell you that I was 4% in, and that was when I started ranting to one of my roommates, and a friend I (apparently) got back into reading. I read this in less than 24 hours (not for a good reason), and my roommate told me it felt like I ranted to her for four days. I think that says enough.Love on the Brain follows Bee, a neuroscientist who lives through asking “What would Marie Curie Do,” has just gotten the opportunity to work on a new collaborative project with NASA, a literal dream. But when she opens up to realize she is co-leading it, she didn’t expect to be co-leading it with Levi Ward, her grad school nemesis. But Levi being in the same building as her is one of her most minor problems. Not only did Levi save her on her first day in the lab, but the equipment she needed to conduct her project is also missing. To make matters worse, the staff isn’t paying attention to her, Levi is somehow becoming an ally, and she finds herself exploring these new feelings about Levi’s new alliance that has her questioning herself. I’ll start with the good.Unlike The Love Hypothesis, I felt like Bee’s support system did not feel forced, annoying, or frustrating. Her RA was a gen-z hoping to get into John Hopkins and continue pursuing her education. While some of her dialogue sometimes felt forced (as if she had to act like someone her age), she still had a lot of moments where she was realistic, funny, and a supportive friend. There’s also Bee’s twin sister, who, although we don’t know much, we can tell they have a strong sibling bond. Most of their interactions are through the phone, but they’re enough to give us an idea of who her sister is. Here, the exchanges themselves didn’t feel forced, and there were no situations where Bee’s inner circle forced her to do anything. Ahn could learn a thing or two from them.And second, I was glad to see this actually take place in a STEM-related location, specifically a lab to conduct the NASA project. Along with science terms used in every chapter’s title, Levi and Bee’s interactions are primarily in the lab. There are also other scientists, whether working on the same projects as Levi and Bee or not, and a clear representation of who is who. There is a lot of political dialogue hidden through romance and comedy (or an attempt, I guess). We see the gender gap between men and women in STEM, the easiness for men, how women are treated, and the general implications of how much more difficult it is for women. Still, I didn’t necessarily like this. More like, appreciated.And now the bad.The writing of Love on the Brain isn’t any better than The Love Hypothesis. In fact, it felt worse. I don’t pay close attention to perspectives, and I’m not the type of person to not read a book because of it, but this is why the first person is tricky. Granted, if you don’t care much about Bee from the beginning, I think this will be a problem throughout the story because Bee’s voice felt sloppy, childish, and immature, as if Bee were talking to us. Sometimes it felt like I was reading multiple diary entries Bee wrote, which felt very in character because of her few immature tendencies. Unfortunately for me, I wasn’t a fan of her from the beginning, so I was dragging myself as I was reading more than 300 pages of boring characters.Like The Love Hypothesis, this lacked a lot of depth. There are a lot of plot devices the author inserts into the book but does not elaborate on them. Since we’re pretty much told everything and shown almost nothing, there are many things the reader is told that add nothing to the story due to zero detail provided to make a theory, add a thought, or understand a point. There’s the example of Levi, who has been going to therapy for years because he grew up in a pretty uncommunicative and not necessarily healthy family environment. He’s now a 32-year-old engineer conducting a massive project at NASA. Yet, there is no further detail on this aspect, which is very unfortunate because the author had the opportunity to provide some sort of awareness for an issue that is pretty big around the world. In other words, the addition of a man who goes to therapy can be a crucial point in a STEM book released in 2022. Yet, it’s weak when you only do it to add a personality or character trait for a character already missing unique characteristics about him. He still lets his parents speak over him, dictating what he should be doing instead of wasting his time or whatnot. I mean, the fact that Bee stood up for him felt rather comical than uplifting. Unwilling to stand up for himself, the scene with his family felt entirely irrelevant to the story. I believe replacing it with a scene about Levi opening up more or talking about himself more to understand better where he comes from could have provided a solid addition to get a different interpretation of him. With the lack of backstory, it can be difficult to understand his actions and interpretations of the world, including his closed feelings for Bee that he hides with a cold glance and supposed hate towards her because he can’t communicate his emotions well. Furthermore, Bee is the kind of character who makes herself the victim. When Levi is opening up himself a little to Bee, telling her more about how his family is and how uncommunicative they are, Bee’s thoughts drift to her saying he at least has a family to hold on to, meaning at least he has someone and that he should be thankful because she doesn’t. This wasn’t the first time Bee came off as selfish and rude, as if she’s the only one struggling.I’m not asking for an entire backstory on both characters. Still, there is so little personality on both of them that it feels like I don’t know either character well enough to form an opinion. I still think the author copied and pasted a lot from her debut novel to this, such as how Levi feels like Adam, and Bee feels like Olive. There wasn’t anything new presented for either character, and it felt like I was reading a cardboard copy of both of them. There is also the the amount of inner monologue Bee spends commenting on how big, broody, and hot Levi is (I even tried highlighting all the scenes, but I probably missed some), which is also what Olive did in TLH all the time. One or two times is enough, but commenting on it all the fucking time on every occasion that Bee sees Levi is entirely unnecessary, annoying as fuck, and even astonishing. Do you notice someone’s physique and general physical features THAT much? The sex scenes, while there are three instead of one, were still horrendous, giving second-hand embarrassment, and similar in terms of semantics and getting them there. Bee also said Levi is big, to which he responds, “You’ll get used to it.” The author really said COPY AND PASTE! There’s also how this is described as enemies to lovers or nemeses to lovers, and Levi is described as grumpy, yet those two are not the case. At all. I’m not even going to bother going into detail about how this was NOT enemies to lovers at all or I will drain myself from my constant disappointment.And now, this is where it gets tricky for me. Levi’s pining that we don’t see from his perspective but are still aware of can be considered of the best parts about this. Clear visuals were evident in how Bee described him, whether through his reactions, inwardly and outwardly, or messages with Bee (who both don’t know who they are). Oblivious to the fact that he likes her, Bee’s inner monologue is formed of intrusive thoughts towards Levi, unknown that Levi is acting the way he is not because she’s unpleasant to him but because he doesn’t know how to be around her. I repeat: CAN be considered the best part. However, maybe it’s just me, but I’m tired of the whole “he likes her, so he’s going to act cold around her and pretend he hates her.” I found it immature and childish, and Levi came off as a middle schooler. As for the “hate,” it was never there. It was gone with a blink of an eye. Between 20-30%, the two were suddenly allies and became friends. This had potential, especially since they were in the same workplace. The opportunity of them actually working together and hating it, yet little by little, they start seeing more about each other, was wasted. Initially, I had thought it would be that way, where the two worked together, with the same equipment and whatnot, and they would slowly but surely start seeing each other in a brighter light. Instead, Bee complains to Levi again, Levi complains about what she complained about, and then he tells her he never actually hated her. Tension? Gone. (Actually, it was never there in the first place).Admittedly, I liked the friendship, and I thought they had a good platonic relationship, but this leads me to my next point. I wasn’t a fan of the romance at all. If the romance had more tension, I could have easily enjoyed this much more. I’m generally a character > plot type of person (Besides, who reads romance for the plot? Romance is the plot). But considering I didn’t really like both main characters here, grew heavily annoyed with the constant and repetitive commentary on the hero’s stance, and felt quite frustrated with the amount of depth missing, it was difficult to root for the romance as well. Personally, the relationship felt much more platonic than romantic. See, despite how romance is the genre I read the most, there are a lot of specific points I look for in almost every romance novel I read. Whether the story has the forbidden trope or not, I’m always looking for those tense moments that add to the chemistry: stolen glances, fingers brushing, hands touching. And if those aren’t included, I appreciate it when the author shows and tells how both characters feel (or, in this case, how Bee was feeling), so the reader can see how they felt. With this not added, it’s hard for me to know where the character is coming from because I don’t even know where they are coming from. There were hardly any scenes where Bee’s feelings were explicitly stated. Even their sex scenes felt like a friends with benefits situation. Their relationship is slow-burn, which I love, but it felt like they were still in their platonic phase because of how slow it was.This will all come down to interpretation and your form of analysis on how you see the relationship, as it always is with books. It’s a subjective manner. While it’s great that their build-up was slow, that slowness felt like it was still rooted in the friend zone, and therefore the attraction the two were developing towards each other felt like it came out of nowhere. Even though Levi already had a crush on Bee, Bee’s feelings towards him could have used further exploration. There are a couple of scenes where they go out, which is great because I’m always a fan of the two main characters spending time together to get to know each other, but again, there is hardly anything new we learn about them. And when we do, we’re left blankly.As for the ending, there’s a lot to unpack (but not in a good way). First, there’s another copy and paste situation, where a random action was thrown in the last 10% of the book as a very predictable situation turns itself in. Not only that, but before that, there was your traditional miscommunication trope added just to create unnecessary emotion and conflict in the story that could have easily been solved if Bee allowed Levi to show her he was serious. Then, suddenly, after the conflict, there’s the epilogue, which in all honesty, I already forgot. If I weren’t lazy right now, I would open the book and take a peek, but that’s unimportant. It’s irrelevant, just like this book.It may seem like I enjoyed this more than TLH, but I didn’t necessarily enjoy anything here. Personally, enjoyment and appreciation or like are different. While I appreciated and liked some things, I wasn’t enjoying anything. I recall pouring my frustration towards people in my social circle more than in this book. In conclusion, Love on the Brain will most likely be another Booktok hit that breaks the internet, and people will shower these mid-20-year-olds and early 30-year-olds with praise that shows how low the standards genuinely are.ARC provided by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."

101,3,Love on the Brain,Ali Hazelwood,101,2022-10-26,Yun,4,"By now, I'm sure you guys already know these tidbits about me—I'm a hopeless, sappy, mushy romantic and I'm a girl in STEM. So of course I adored Love on the Brain.Bee has a PhD in neuroscience, but she's struggling to find recognition and funding for her projects. So when she gets the call from NASA to work on one of their helmet prototypes, it sounds like a dream come true. The only catch: she has to work alongside Levi, her archnemesis from grad school. But as she spends more time with him, she starts to realize that maybe they don't really hate each other after all and it's actually something else altogether.If I had to pick the one thing I enjoyed the most about this book, it isn't the romance. Shocking, I know. Rather, it's the writing. There's something about Ali Hazelwood's style, with its blend of snark and humor, that just completely has me in its thralls. Often I would find myself grinning from cheek to cheek, chuckling to myself while Bee held some amusing and sarcastic conversation or inner dialogue. I think it's because she says all the things I want to say, if only I were quick and clever enough to come up with it.And there were so many puns! Science puns, cat puns, Marie Curie puns. I love me a good pun (or a bad one, I'm not that discerning), so I was in pun-heaven.I have to mention the science in here. I don't know anything about neuroscience, but reading this book made me wish I did. I wanted so badly for the technology in here to be real, so that I could marvel at how cool it is and totally nerd out learning more about it. Add in the NASA/astronaut angle, and your resident space-science fangirl here was swooning.In terms of the romance itself, I enjoyed it, but it wasn't my favorite thing about this book. I found the transition from we're-frenemies to we're-getting-it-on to be a bit sudden. It seemed like they were solidly in the former category, and then all of a sudden, they were in the latter category. I guess I wanted more of a slow progression and steamy anticipation than what I got.Still, the coupling of Bee and Levi was a fun one. Of course due to their previous interactions, Bee would assume that Levi hates her. And of course she'd be slow to figure it out, resulting in rather funny misunderstandings between them. However, I can totally see the pitchforks coming out for this couple—how it's completely unrealistic, how there's no way it would take her this long to come to her senses. I mean, sure, it's unrealistic, but that feels like the entire romance genre to me. It always necessitates a certain suspension of disbelief to enjoy, which totally worked for me here. Your mileage may vary.As an aside, I was checking out some articles about the author (I was super curious about her scientific research), and found out Ali Hazelwood is a pen name. Apparently, in her real life, none of her colleagues or students have mentioned her books to her, so she thinks no one has made the connection yet. Ha, imagine that! At this point, I can safely add Ali Hazelwood to my list of must-read authors. I've loved both of her full-length novels (I'm a little iffier on her novellas, but I'm generally not a fan of novellas). I find her writing style to be supremely entertaining and her focus on science and women in STEM to be refreshing. It's always a joy to dig into one of her stories, and I can't wait for more.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:The Love HypothesisThe STEMinist NovellasUnder One RoofStuck with You~~~~~~~~~~~~This was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

103,3,Love on the Brain,Ali Hazelwood,103,2022-09-28,SK,2," Wow, what a wild ride. It had its moments, ups and downs, but mostly it was The Love Hypothesis, Adam and Olive but call them Levi and Bee. Get ready for a lengthy review cause it's about to get wild af! The book starts off pretty well. The pacing is consistent and of course Ali Hazelwood is a talented writer. She can write a book which you'll find yourself easy to get lost in. The concept is pretty good- guy falls for her first, they're pen pals, based in STEM, etc etc. But while she is talented, she is also lazy-  because instead of recycling garbage she recycled the adored script of The Love Hypothesis. I went into this book with an open mind. Had no intentions of comparing it to The Love Hypothesis, but as I started making progress it became quite clear that it is the  EXACT same formula as The Love Hypothesis. There's just no denying that. It became harder to not compare the two, so do bear with me. Adam and Olive were so easy to like, their angst came so naturally. The side characters were so full of personality. Love on the Brain, on the other hand discards all that. We get  Bee,  who is supposedly super smart and one of the best. Tell me why does she have to be so dumb in the emotional sense?! It was irritating for me to constantly read how Levi hates her, when the guy could not be more clear in his feelings. He actually even said it!! Also, the fact that she kept interrupting/rambling every time the other person talks to her?? What's that about?! I also did not appreciate her inner monologues. It was overly done and felt like a filler. One more thing, why did she need to wear her grandmother's wedding band on her ring finger? That's just weird. If Hazelwood is like that in reality, I would not get along with her at all. Like her character Bee, she continued to ramble on in the last 100 pages. I'm not even kidding 🥲 Coming towards  Levi, I admit I hated him at first, his attitude was quite arrogant which I was not a fan of. But once I got to know him, I liked him, more than Bee. Much more. The two have good chemistry and they're cute together BUT sadly, they could not create the magic that Adam and Olive created. I appreciated the occasional humour in the book, I think Hazelwood writes that quite well. I loved the dm exchange on twitter, it brought the book more depth. My other problem was the fact that Hazelwood made it uncomfortable by forcing, yes forcing, situations which became misogynistic when there's absolutely no requirement to do so. For instance- Levi's playlist. Let the man listen to what he wants without creating an issue Bee. He has already displayed numerous times he's not a misogynist. I get it that there are men who are misogynists, and it is a sad harsh reality but you don't need to bring down men unnecessarily. Don't forget the fact that I am a woman myself. I know what my rights are. I know what I deserve. I know how to make a stand for myself. I know what the reality is. I know how us women struggle. But I also know, I don't have to bring down anyone or any man, especially when the person is doing nothing wrong. I also know not to hate on men without any reason. It's just unnecessary and uncalled for.I hope in the future, Hazelwood writes books with a new hypothesis. The same formula can't work every time when it comes to writing. Love Theoretically is already a let down in my eyes, but I'll give it a go for the cover, which I'm sure will look cute on my bookshelf (I'm weird that way) and that will be it for my experience with the author. While I appreciate that she writes about STEM and especially women in STEM- does she not have any other ideas? Does she not want to put in effort to explore and write something newer? Can she not write anything without the miscommunication trope?If you do want to give this a read, please do so. I hope you love it more than me."
104,3,Love on the Brain,Ali Hazelwood,104,2022-08-29,Alyssa Thomas,4,"⭐️⭐️⭐️.5/5 starsI am still struggling on whether or not to round up or down, so if my star rating changes just know that's me being indecisive af. Even though I didn't LOVEEE The Love Hypothesis I did enjoy it overall even though there were some aspects I didn't like (the over-the-top SA storyline for one) and I especially liked how fun it was to read. The same is the case for Love on the Brain. Overall I enjoyed many parts of this book and it was fun to read! That being said, there were quite a few things that I did not enjoy and honestly, they were a little bit more unbearable in this book than in TLH because at this point I have read FIVE published works from this author (yes I am counting the novellas as published works since it is technically true despite not being full size novels!) 👎 WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: 👎* The straight up stupidity of the heroine - and sadly, this isn't an anomaly! This seems to be Ali Hazelwood's signature! Which I greatly do not enjoy! I love that her heroines work in STEM, but honestly is she giving STEM a good name if ALL of her heroines are incredibly dumb and not emotionally intelligent?!?!?! Decide for yourself because I've already decided and the answer is I FUCKING HATE IT ALL. I truly cannot fathom how her heroines (and sadly Bee is included) are soooo smart when it comes to academia, but not real life. UGH. I truly understand that not everyone is going to see that someone actually likes them when there are so many instances where it looks like they don't. But I swear, 4 or 5 mentions PER FUCKING PAGE about how much Levi OBVIOUSLY hated Bee was just soooo fucking over the top and unnecessary. * The ridiculous villains - I hated the SA side plot in TLH (mostly because I am very selective about SA plotlines), but I also did not like the villain side plot in LotB. I won't spoil who it is or what happened, but when it was ""revealed"" I literally said ""This is so fucking stupid!"" out loud. Because why? It's so fucking stupid. I just don't think her books need these ridiculous and over-the-top side plots. * Most of the side characters - Sorry not sorry, but Rocio is annoying as fuck. She's incredibly unprofessional and cringey. I didn't enjoy any scene that she was in. I also wasn't too hip on Bee's sister whose name I have already forgotten. So many of their conversations were cringe. 👍 SO WHAT DID I ENJOY? 👍* This book read very quickly - almost 400 pages and yet I didn't want to stop reading. I was enjoying the ride even though it was quite ridiculous at times.* The tease of Levi redeeming himself - we know it's coming!! And I couldn't wait for it to happen! And I was satisfied! * The sex scenes! - everyone will have a different opinion, but the sex scenes worked for me although I think they had PIV too early. I would have preferred one more scene where they did some touching/grinding before PIV, but it doesn't really matter at the end of the day. * The twitter messages! - possibly spoilers so hiding it here. Although I think anyone with two brain cells would be able to guess that Levi is actually Schmac. Anyway, loved this!!! I especially love that there wasn't a plotline where Bee had a crush on Schmac. She liked talking to him for sure, but there was no ""Do I like Levi or do I like this internet friend?!!?!"" Although part of me thinks it would have been so delicious if Levi would have figured it out first based on some VERY OBVIOUS sign that the readers picked up on, but of course not Bee's oblivious-ass. Anyway, this was good! 🤙 WHAT I DON'T CARE ABOUT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER 🤙* Big guy/small girl - honestly I consider this to fall under the category of ""don't yuck someone's yum"". Even though it's not my FAVORITE trope I don't think this feature of Hazelwood's books/novellas warrants all the vitriol it receives. Like it or not, she's not doing something ""wrong"" by featuring this in her books. (Fight me!)👏 IN CONCLUSION 👏 This book is going to get FUCKING ROASTED and I'm honestly here for it lmao. All criticisms are valid, especially all criticisms of this fucking book. Despite all of that I did enjoy this book...even if I was constantly irritated lmao. I'll continue to read books and novellas by this author, but I seriously SERIOUSLY hope she tries something new with her heroines. -------------------------------------pre-ordered kindle version 1/20/22-------------------------------------THIS COVER IS THE FUCKING CUTEST!!!!! I NEED A POSTER OF IT ON MY WALL. 😍💗-------------------------------------Based on the single chapter preview at the end of The Love Hypothesis, this book is going to be a favorite. I already know. There is no information about this book anywhere online yet, but what I gather from the first chapter is STEM + You've Got Mail trope. Sign me the frick up!!"
105,3,Love on the Brain,Ali Hazelwood,105,2022-01-21,Ali Hazelwood,5,"hi hi HELLO, just wanted you guys to know that there is a list of content notes/trigger warnings for the book on my website ❤️https://alihazelwood.com/lotb-cw/"
106,3,Love on the Brain,Ali Hazelwood,106,2022-11-07,marwah,1,I don't want to talk about it.
107,3,Love on the Brain,Ali Hazelwood,107,2022-11-01,Phuong ✯,3,"– 2.5 starsi’m sad to say this, but i think my bestie Ali Hazelwood might be a one hit wonder. She wrote imo one of the best debut romance novel and it blew up and because of that she’s just running with the same characters, the same tropes, the same settings, but different names and it failed. Olive & Adam had a certain charm that Bee & Levi are completely lacking.Tropes: 🚀 ‘enemies’-to-lovers🚀 a neuroscientist (h) + an engineer (H)🚀 women in STEM & sexist men in that same field🚀 secret pen pals🚀 smol girl - ginormous guy🚀 quirky heroine – grumpy Hero🚀 Hero is a fucking simp, but shows it in the dumbest way possible🚀 ✨ miscommunication ✨🚀 monster dick🚀 praise kink🚀 catslet’s jump straight to the character talk, cause I cannot summarize the plot of this book even if my life depends on it: – Bee Königswasser (h) –first of all, why is this female character last name named after a chemical compound of acids aka aqua regia and second of all did you know that if you translate Königswasser literally it means ‘royal water’ uhm.. why? i know Bee wants to be Marie Curie so badly, but okay that’s one way to shove science down our throat at every chance. besides Bee’s obsession with Marie Curie, she’s also highkey in love with cats. everytime she was making a cat pun, thinking it’s the purr-fect response a human has ever given, a part of my soul shrivels. don’t come for me, i’m just trying to match her energy. 🤚
To be fair, there isn’t much to think about. I only remember up until the moment I fainted. Yes, I swooned in His Wardness’s manly arms like a twentieth-century hysteric with penis envy.
if you think WHAT, yeah same. that’s how it was like to be in Miss Royal Water’s head. exhausting.– Levi Ward (H) –facts i know with 100% certainty about Levi:
1. he’s tall 2. he has green eyes3. he’s TALL (the caps are necessary, how else do i highlight his tallness)4. his eyes are really really green 5. he is over 6’2 ft and you’ll get his eyes color if you mix blue and yellow together (look at me bringing kindergarden science into my review, Ali are you proud????)6. he despises Elon Musk7. he’s 6’4 ft tall to be exact8. Levi Green™ eyesi understand that Levi comes from a highly dysfunctional family, has never learned to communicate and it really shows. but boy did he give me and Bee nothing to work with at the beginning with his zero communication skills. we are talking about a man who refused to sit next to his crush bc in his word ‘it was hard to think when you were close’. is it cute that he was so tongue-tied around Bee? sure yeah kinda, but it’s more embarrassing, cause they are ADULTS and not 8. what else is on my notes for Levi: while i don’t really remember that much about Levi as you can tell by that list above, i love how Ali writes her Heroes and how they are pining so hard for the heroine for years. he was simping so hard and we’re all here to see it 💅 – romance –Levi and Bee romance pretty much gave me Edward and Bella twilight biology class vibes Bee wearing her special dress and Levi acting all too disgusted, but is actually simping hardcore on the inside is the same twilight scene but in different fonts. the first half of this book didn’t really catch my interest that much and it was more in the 2 stars area, bc how much these characters were avoiding each other and couldn’t communicate. but once Levi confessed his obsession with Bee over their anonymous twitter chat it got more better. background info: Bee and Levi both have secret twitter accounts namely @whatwouldmariedo and @shmac where they tweet about hindrances working in STEM and where they talk to each other. they are chatting and Levi as shmac has no problem confessing his unrequired love for Bee to Bee. 
SHMAC: I know what she smells like. This little freckle on her neck when she pulls up her hair. Her upper lip is a little plumper than the lower. The curve of her wrist, when she holds a pen. It’s wrong, really wrong, but I know the shape of her. I go to sleep thinking about it, and then I wake up, go to work, and she is there, and it’s impossible. I tell her stuff I know she’ll agree to, just to hear her hum back at me. It’s like hot water down my fucking spine. She’s married. She’s brilliant. She trusts me, and all I think about is taking her to my office, stripping her, doing unspeakable things to her. And I want to tell her. I want to tell her that she’s luminous, she’s so bright in my mind, sometimes I can’t focus. Sometimes I forget why I came into the room. I’m distracted. I want to push her against a wall, and I want her to push back. I want to go back in time and punch her stupid husband on the day I met him and then travel back to the future and punch him again. I want to buy her flowers, food, books. I want to hold her hand, and I want to lock her in my bedroom. She’s everything I ever wanted and I want to inject her into my veins and also to never see her again. There’s nothing like her and these feelings, they are fucking intolerable. They were half-asleep while she was gone, but now she’s here and my body thinks it’s a fucking teenager and I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to do. There is nothing I can do, so I’ll just . . . not.
man was pouring his heart out and how can you not feel for him and smell his desperation? he thought she was married ffs but was still so obsessed with Bee 💀 when is it my turn where a guy wants to inject me into his veins??? 😔– side characters –where is the petition to see a bonus chapter of Rocia (Bee’s assistant) and Kaylee (Levi’s assistant) having intercourse on Bee’s office desk infront of a camera. I was more invested in the side character and what they were up to compared to the main characters. Ali Hazelwood always manages to write the most hilarious secondary characters and they may be over the top with their personalities, but that’s right up my alley. 
Rocío’s boots hit the floor. Hard. “I love her,” she declares. “She’s perfect. I want her to be my beautiful California Bride with pink ribbons in her hair. I want to give her bubble baths that smell like cotton candy. I want to buy her fruity cocktails with little umbrellas in them.” She leans forward, pinning me with her gaze. “I will wear glitter for her, Bee. Black glitter.”
– same old, same old – we talked about the characters that are the mini version of Olive and Adam, but with even worse communication skills. very similar tropes and vibes to The Love Hypothesis. those are all things that are unexciting, but things that can be overlooked, but recycling scenes again is just lazy writing at this point. i’m talking about the same sex scene where Adam Levi tells Olive Bee that he wants to fuck her and follows with the question “Can I fuck you?” now, listen besties, i love a consensual king as much as the next person, but i can’t believe we are getting the same dialogue twice. let’s not forget that Levi’s monster cock is so huge that it’s tearing Bee’s vag in half .. does that sound familiar? no? okay hint go read chapter 16 of The Love Hypothesis. moreover, i can’t believe we didn’t get a proper love confession in Love on the Brain either.. that was such a minus point in TLH for me and Ali is repeating the same mistake again that Levi is confessing his love for Bee, but Bee is only thinking it when she says she loves Levi in the epilogue.. did i miss something?? it was so unsatisfying. 
”I can give you nice. I can give you better than nice. I can give you everything.” He smiles at me, full of hope. “You don’t even have to admit to yourself that you love me, Bee. God knows I love you enough for the both of us. But I need you to stay. I need you to stick around.”
that conflict at the end of the book was so fucking dramatic and for what 🤣😭 it was so predictable that some white mediocre dude who was good for nothing was going to be the problem for the heroine, but i didn’t see it coming that Guy (that’s the villain’s name i’m not kidding) was literally pointing a gun at Bee and Levi like the Hulk had to wrestle him to the ground ｡･ﾟﾟ･ Conclusion ･ﾟﾟ･｡was this book a disappointment to read after how much i loved The Love Hypothesis? yup. did i expect anything different? nope. after reading two out of three novellas i knew what i would get myself into cause Ali just loves her miscommunication & tiny quirky girl and huge grumpy guy trope. while this is a formula that works out pretty well for now, i hope that Ali will change it up in future novels, cause she has the potential to be better, otherwise she’s just going to be another Sally Thorne, which is not necessary the worst fate for an romance author, but i made my point."
108,3,Love on the Brain,Ali Hazelwood,108,2023-01-01,Cindy,4,Fun and steamy and even more enjoyable than The Love Hypothesis! I am a simple woman who wants a big sturdy man to pine for me for doing absolutely nothing! I support Ali Hazelwood for writing all my favorite tropes!
109,3,Love on the Brain,Ali Hazelwood,109,2023-01-31,Zoe (Marauders version) ,4,"edit a friend just brought to my attention that when Ali said galaxy leggings she was actually referring to black holes and so it’s just black leggings 🤷‍♀️ and that is now canon to me. At this very moment i wish i was one of those sophisticated reviewers that had fair but true critiques of this book, and don't get me wrong there are very many.but this book gives me all the fuzzy feelings as a women in stem so i am willing to ignore all of them.i will ignore the contstant pop culture referances, the galaxy leggins( i cant even 💀), the very infuriating misscomunication, the constant stream of facts about marie curie (yes she is amazing but chill). i will ignore them because i WANT to like this book and i do i love the premise, women in stem the reality of what its like for them in the workplace, and the online friends (i fucking love that trope so much i dont know why, maybe the talking about the girl with no filter ugh i love it) and of course Levi we love a man in stem that recognises that he is the minority and that we need to bring in other people for different perspectives. i could go on and on about women in stem but i won't, i dont have the right audiance here so ill leave you with this:""Nothing in life is to be feared; it is only to be understood"" - Marie Curie (as according to google) {previous review}Currently running off 4 hours of sleep, i know i will probably never write a proper review for this so here is my half ass try rn.-I loved this book I really did, It made me happy. No it was not a literary masterpiece but I don't care at all, I was kicking my feet and giggling as I read Bees and Levis scenes. -I feel like Ali made herself Bee. They both love cats, star wars - Ali wrote a bestselling Reylo fanfic ffs, and dying there hair i think? (is Ali's hair dyed, idk) and they both love neuroscience. I feel like she daydreamed her romance (lets be real we all do) but then didn't change herself as the main character and wrote and published it. -Yes, this was a repeat of TLH but in my humble opinion, better, smuttier, and more sciencey (yayyyy stem!!!) and it had engineers sorry i love engineering. But if Ali doesnt break that mold its gonna become real old real fast.-Bees character really annoyed me. Levi had to tell miss gurl he didn't hate her like 16 times. Girl c'mon hes loved you since grad school stfu. I would kill to have a Levi and your like this, bish. And she would not shut up about Marie, i dont even know what her last name was because I skipped over whenever she would talk about her. I mean i get it your twitters based off it but woah that got old quick. - There was a scene where Bee said ""okay daddy"" and i physically couldn't do it. I slammed down my kindle and walked around my room because ew, that was disgusting. -AND GUESS WHAT MY FRIENDS WE GOT LESBIANS IN A STEM NOVEL WITH GRUMPY SUNSHINE 'ENEMIES TO LOVERS' AND GUY OBSESSED WITH GIRL WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO WANT???-Also wanna say that as an aspiring engineer, it was so cool to see where and how everyone worked together and when they worked stuff out to further the project my heart was full of pride. for people on paper. god im pathetic lmao.-And guess what, we got a 'Good girl"" scene. Good god that was hot. I love Levi with all my heart you know what i cant even tell you how much because I love him too much. Him with children and on her side the entire time and that text message that was like a page long (ifykyk) made my heart ache. We need more Levis in the world. But sadly, we have Tims and Guys I hate Tims and Guys. Fuck them.-also guess what i guessed everything that was going to happen at 5% not to brag or anything. lmao. but i still enjoyed it thoroughly- Also I wanna bring up a point I saw on another review on this book by Kat I think her name was. She brought up that in these books its all about women being independent and being a women in stem and not needing a man. And yeah I agree with that. But then the man is always there to get her out of a bad case of sexual harassment, which yup, i know its a romance novel and there's gonna be some saving but like, why cant she save herself. Or she could be going well and the guy comes in to 'assist' not to 'save her' per se. You know? I just think that that defeats the whole purpose of the novel. ✨women in stem✨ (if you have any rec like this plz drop down below)I know Ali will never see this but if you do please consider my advicepeace out friends, i'm off to get some much needed sleep. {previous review}I am so pissed that I liked this, i had the most amazing review planned out for when i hated itnews flash i didnt, i loved iti just had 4 hours of sleep because i stayed up reading this.......and i have a full day of schoolbut you know what i dont care this book made me warm and fuzzy insideis it like the TLH?

110,3,Love on the Brain,Ali Hazelwood,110,2022-09-07,Matilda ,2,"2 stars 🧠i’m gonna keep this review short and sweet, but there were quite a lot of things i disliked about this book.
miscommunication
this is essentially the foundation of this book. i mean, levi (H) ignoring bee (h) for years and basically running out of the room because he thought bee was married isn’t justifiable and is downright cruel.he practically tried to sabotage her career at every turn. when he wasn’t actively sabotaging it, he was making her think he wasto make matters worse, bee furthered this confusion by wearing her grandmother’s wedding ring…on her ring finger. mind you she didn’t realize he thought she was married, well until she LIED TO HIM ABOUT BEING IN A RELATIONSHIP (multiple times and to other people)like when a guy asks her out on a date and levi replies for her, “oh she’s married”. to which the guy apologizes ‘in case he made her uncomfortable’—
“Oh, it’s fine. I’m not . . .” Married, I want to say, but it would be a waste of the amazing out Levi gave me. I cough. “I’m not bothered.”
what did this solve? i believe levi finds out at around 50% that she’s not married the crazy part was, i kinda missed the miscommunication as i progressed past the 50% mark 😭 the story just felt very lackluster after
endless cringe
bee is about as cringey as her name. idk why it didn’t click in my head till 25% that she was named after an insect.i kinda lost it when she started throwing out cat puns when baby talking a kitty—
“Aren’t you the most purr-fect little baby? I feel so fur-tunate to have met you.”
according to bee, non vegans are banned from eating vegan foods! how dare anyone even attempt to!!!
“And one more thing,” I snarl into his stony face. “Vegan donuts are for vegans, you absolute walnut.”
i can’t forget the scene where bee scolds levi because he has no female artists on his playlist.
“Right. That’s why you have exactly . . .” I scroll down for a few seconds. More seconds. A minute. “. . . a grand total of zero female-performed songs on your phone.”
bestie, maybe if you scrolled for a minute and 1 second you would have found some 🥸this may be surprising for her to learn but some people enjoy genres of music where women didn’t/don’t make big strides in or are hard to find
smut
most lackluster and lazy smut i’ve read by her. you can’t have levi say one “good girl” and expect me to swoon 😒
levi
i’m still looking for his personality 🤨
large, colossal, gargantuan, cumbersome
if you took a shot everyone time bee mentioned levi’s size, you would be dead from alcohol poisoning.
A face attached to a large, solid body—a body that is pinning me to the wall, a body made of a broad chest and two thighs that could moonlight as redwoods.
i can’t really think of a solid reason why i’m giving this 2 stars instead of 1, but i guess it was tolerable enough for me to finish in a few hoursi swear i've read this book before...oh yeah, it’s called the love hypothesis 😴"
111,3,Love on the Brain,Ali Hazelwood,111,2022-06-06,myo ✧༺ ༘♡ ༻∞,3,"this was good but not as good as the first book, i wasn’t that interested in the plot of this book. i did like the romance more but at times i found myself bored also it was really annoying how the characters in this book talked. and this book focuses so much on the science and i’m not gonna lie i didn’t care about that shit. it was fine in the love hypothesis but in this book it was like excessive it took me out of the story. i love that the author focuses on women in stem but she should work on a balance on how she writes her science cus girl i’m not trying to read about that, it was i would go read a sci-fi book, im trying read some characters F*CK okay?"
112,3,Love on the Brain,Ali Hazelwood,112,2022-08-23,Júlia,5,"Happy Release Day to Love on the Brain!  I received an Advanced Reader Copy for this book in exchange for an honest review  I don't give five stars often...  If you liked the love hypothesis, this book is here to break it's neck, spit on it and bury it under every white cis male who has ever taken credit for a woman's groundbreaking discovery in the history of human kind.  I read this is one sitting and I am so pleasantly surprised. Ali has taken her writing to another level, the feminist way she approaches women is STEM is adorably funny. This book is brainy and grindy and I that is why I love it so much. It is SO MUCH more than just a quirky FMC with a brooding male main character, it's a women's science history book. It's a call out to sexist work environments, it's a call out to standardized tests, it's a SAFE PLACE.  I have always been a nerdy kid, liking and wanting to be places women were not supposed to be a part of, video games, sports, dinosaur/archeology/science camps...It is so refreshing to see that someone out there is doing MORE with their romcoms than sticking to the cookie cutter recipe.  I am sick and tired of reading the same stories behind different cartoon covers. Ali DELIVERED.  There are so many reasons I loved this so much but I have to remain spoiler free, but I will say: this is the first time Ali writes a female main character whose voice and personality I absolutely adore.   The side characters in this? Unbelievable.  The amount of times she made me laugh out loud? Uncountable.  How hard I swooned? Way too hard.  Am I desperately in love with this book and Levi? Undoubtedly.  
A masterpiece. 
  YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST: The same way I knew People We Meet on Vacation was going to win (and I was right) This book is the new winner of the 2022 Goodreads Choice Awards in the romance category.    I have no words to describe how much I enjoyed every single page of this book. I'll dare say this is possibly one of my favorite books of 2022 so far."
113,3,Love on the Brain,Ali Hazelwood,113,2022-11-06,Ali Goodwin,4,"4.5 stars!! I read this book in less than 24 hours because I loved it that much. Ali Hazelwood writes such fun quirky characters and I love the science/academic world this book takes place in. I've heard a lot of people say this book is very similar to The Love Hypothesis, and although I agree, I loved it SO much. I actually laughed out loud at several parts which is rare for me."
114,3,Love on the Brain,Ali Hazelwood,114,2022-08-23,Anna,5,"Special thanks to Edelweiss and the publisher for giving me an ARC of this book for an honest review.HAPPY RELEASE DAY, LOVE ON THE BRAIN!!! 💕AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! I honestly can’t believe I was lucky enough to get to read this book early!!!! What an absolute dream!!!!Love on the Brain was everything I could ever want from a new Ali Hazelwood and more! It was hilarious and angsty and heart-warming and it read like a warm hug feels.The story is told from the perspective of the heroine, neuroscientist and Marie-Curie-obsessed Bee Königswasser (watch me spell that right on the first try!!). Bee has a thing about not getting pets or forming meaningful romantic relationships because all these bonds will end up breaking her heart one way or another. Pets die, people leave, you get it. I feel like some people will find this part of her a little frustrating, but I… completely related? Lol, I can be the exact same way sometimes, which made this book’s message so personal and beautiful to me.Anyway. We also have the man, the myth, the legend, Levi Ward!!! He’s a grumpy engineer who’s hated Bee since grad school for unknown reasons (OR HAS HE???). He likes hummingbirds and Star Wars and a certain Target dress in a certain neuroscientist and THAT’S ALL I’LL SAY ABOUT IT DON’T ASK ME TO ELABORATE!!!!Bee and Levi are paired up to co-lead a project at NASA, which starts out with Levi saving Bee from a fallen piece of machinery and saving her life. But don’t worry, this changes nothing, they still hate each other, so what if he smells like all her deepest fantasies???Watching Bee fall in love with Levi was so beautiful; you can only pretend someone is not your best friend for so long. I guess my one thing with this book would be that there was a certain plot point that felt a little recycled from The Love Hypothesis, which you can pretty much tell right away. But am I complaining? I would NEVER.I truly cannot wait for everyone to read this book and freak out with me. It was SO SO GOOD!!!!!!!Also, final remark: watch out for 47%. Bring all the tissues. 😫❤️ 🥰"
115,3,Love on the Brain,Ali Hazelwood,115,2023-01-13,Isabelle Reads,1,"“My career gasped for air like a hippo with sleep apnea.”so did mine, Bee. In fact, my hands were shaking just typing this up. You might’ve noticed the one star. Let’s get into a nice, long, multiple-page rant review, shall we? 🥰THE SYNOPSIS.Neuroscientist Girl (aka Bee) is hired at NASA for a special project and realizes she has to co-lead a project with grad-school archnemesis Engineer Boy (aka Levi). Drama ensues.THE CHARACTERS.Bee Königswasser.Bee. Oh, Bee. Before I really rip into Miss Bumblebee, let me provide a mere ✨sample✨ of the thoughts and questions from my head as I read this book:13%: Why is Bee wearing her grandmother’s wedding ring when she isn’t married? That’s weird. No one wears wedding rings for luck. That definitely won’t cause misunderstandings later.16%: Why is it such a problem that she and Levi share the same movie taste? More than one person can like the Empire Strikes Back. This isn’t kindergarten.34%: I’m bored. These two idiots don’t know how to talk to each other.55%: FIFTY-FIVE PERCENT. Why has it taken until FIFTY-FIVE PERCENT FOR THEM TO START COMMUNICATING FINALLY.70%: Did Bee just have a personality transplant? Why does she like Levi so much all of a sudden? 75%: WOAH HOLD UP, did we really feel the need to go from 0 to 69?? WHERE WAS THE CONTEXT FOR THIS??76%: Just found out Bee is literally named after a poem about bees. It’s not just a nickname. I can’t with this book.88%: THAT’S THE THIRD ACT CONFLICT? MISS BUMBLEBEE YOU IDIOT—That’s enough of that.Bee, in case you couldn’t infer it already, is a grad school educated idiot. A professional doofus. Why can this girl quickly realize when Mr. Not-Main-Love-Interest asks her out BUT SHE OBVIOUSLY DOESN’T SEE EVEN ONE OF THE VAST NUMBER OF BLUSHES AND FLUSHES AND SWALLOWS AND PANIC MOMENTS THAT LEVI HAS IN HER PRESENCE NO SHE DOES NOT.In addition to her boneheadedness and the fact that she cries at roadkill, trips quirkily, and faints all the time, Bee also has anger management issues. In fact, now that I think about it, all of Ali Hazelwood’s heroines seem to love fantasizing about violently murdering people. Particularly their love interests. With regards to Bee, she thought about poisoning, stabbing, drowning, impaling, and biting Levi at various points. That’s not even counting what she wanted to do to all the side characters.Clearly, a very stable lady. However, the worst thing Bee ever says is the following, (taken from one of her complaints about the lack of females in STEM teams):“The well-known Meatwave. A Dickspolsion in the Testosteroven. The good old Brodeo.”*ahem* now, Bee, I understand you think life is a war against men, and men have done nothing good in the entirety of human history, but—WHERE IS THE BLEACH. I NEED TO THOROUGHLY SCRUB MY BRAIN PLEASE NEVER SAY THAT AGAIN I BEG YOULevi Ward.Nothing to say here. This man was the Ideal Science Gentleman, which means he was Bee’s ideal of what the perfect man should be and the only one who had a reason for his horrible communication skills.THE ROMANCE.Oh, that romance. If one could even call it that. LITERALLY ALL OF THE TENSION WAS A SERIES OF MISUNDERSTANDINGS.THAT IS NOT ✨TENSION✨ THAT’S BEING PROUD OF THE COMMUNICATION ISSUES OF A FOUR-YEAR-OLD.For the first half of the book, the only tangible reason Bee is civil to Levi is because of his big, huge, enormous body and those hulking, massive biceps and his huge warm chest and no I’m not being excessive because BEE CANNOT SHUT UP ABOUT HIS BODY.Like ma’am, please be more creative. Lust for huge enormous manly bodies is overdone and not at all connected to actual love.Take these mere snippets:“Is Levi actually handsome? Or is he just six four and built like the Colossus of Rhodes?”“‘Can’t be taller than six two, or shorter than five one.’I briefly contemplate the notion that neither Levi nor I fall within astronaut height requirements, but for dramatically different reasons.”“I stare at this man who’s six four and two hundred pounds of muscle.”“He manages to sound sincere, as though he’s not a six four, two-hundred-pound brickhouse.”“The walls are too high for me to climb—because I’m five feet tall and everything is too high for me to climb.”wow Bee you’re so small and Levi’s so big and you’re so teeny teeny tiny and he’s such a hulking beast and you’re just a dust particle and he’s a dinosaur CAN YOU PLEASE STOP TALKING ABOUT HIS BODYAnd then after the halfway mark, suddenly she adores him and they’ve had all these cute and not totally contrived moments together and they’re 69’ing three bloody times. (side note to those curious: they’re skippable, but don’t read this book anyway not worth it)THE PLOT.Most of the book was talking about this BLINK project they have for NASA. It was actually a pretty cool project, but I'm here to rant so you may read about it elsewhere.First off, why was EVERY SINGLE male character in this book a woman-objectifying trashy dude? (except, rather conveniently, our main man 🙄) Yes, many men steal research ideas and make disgusting comments about women’s bodies. Yes, science is a historically male- and white- dominated field with a great deal of sexism. But this particular subset of male scientists does not represent EVERY SINGLE man on the planet. I don't want to be lectured about gender stereotypes and oppression and misogyny while reading a romance novel. Those things have their place, but NOT ON EVERY OTHER PAGE PLEASE. I’M TRYING TO WATCH PEOPLE FALL IN LOVE.And another thing: women are not all perfect gorgeous angels. In this book, practically everything a female character does is brave, kind, and accommodating, while everything a male character does is aggressive, bigoted, and hateful. I’m more than happy to call out sexism when deserved, but it's hypocritical to call out sexism against women when, if the roles were reversed, you’d be guilty of the exact same thing. Case in point:“I was initially a bit distrustful of him – his bio says “he/him,” and we all know how men on the internet can be.” Well gee Bee, if you'd said—“I was initially a bit distrustful of her – her bio says “she/her,” and we all know how women on the internet can be.” —you’d be called out as a raging misogynist. But because it was about a man, you’re a feminist empowerment queen and 100% in the right. As a woman myself, I’m calling bs 🤦‍♀️ *sigh* Anyways, that's it. I know I was a little melodramatic, but I’ve been stuck in this girl's head for 368 pages and need a significant amount of therapy. And venting. So that’s what I did here for over four pages.Thanks for listening, y'all, I appreciate it ❤️Ratings: Star Rating: ★☆☆☆☆If This Book Was a Movie Rating: RRecommendations That Are Better Than This Book:The Hating Game by Sally ThorneFinding Cinderella by Kia Amazona"
116,3,Love on the Brain,Ali Hazelwood,116,2022-12-16,aleksandra,4,"“You were always in my head. And I could never get you out.”""I can give you nice. I can give you better than nice. I can give you everything.” He smiles at me, full of hope “You don’t even have to admit to yourself that you love me, Bee. God knows I love you enough for the both of us.""I was kinda scared when people were writing in their reviews that it will be similar to The Love Hypothesis, because 3 novels from this author have really similar vibes to TLH and I really wanted this book to be slightly different. Also it was one of my most anticipated books of the year.Let’s star from the positive things in this book, our main characters Bee and Levi, well I LOVE them. Smut scenes are soo good and I’m so happy there was more than one scene like in TLH. Subplot from Rocío and Kaylee was really cute and Rocío is probably my second favorite character from this book. Most importantly, even though Levi was kinda getting on my nerves at first, from the things he was doing to Bee, I feel in love with him. I mean, he owns A CAT, that’s the biggest green flag😌. Plus this man was crazy about our main character, so it’s really hard not to fall for him. Now from the annoying things, firstly Levi is basically Adam. I love that in her novellas characters were let’s say slightly more diverse, even though all her characters all white people in ✨STEM✨. Maybe small spoiler ( skip if you want ), but the miscommunication about her marriage was really annoying me (and I was damn relieved when he found out about it in 50% of the book🥲👍). Also I find it really weird that they shared A LOT favorite things, like I get it two people can share favorite stuff, but suddenly Levi likes everything she likes, idk maybe it’s only weird for me.If you like books about women in STEM with great plot and writing, you should definitely read it. I can’t wait for more books from Ali Hazelwood!😩"
117,3,Love on the Brain,Ali Hazelwood,117,2023-03-11,Nenia ✨ I yeet my books back and forth ✨ Campbell,3,"

Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestThe woman, the myth, the legend: Ali Hazelwood is one of those authors that, like Colleen Hoover and Sarah J. Maas, people either love or hate. With passion. Which obviously makes me wonder what the heck she was putting in her books to make people solidly Team Yuck or Team Yum. With passion. Finally, one of her books went on sale-- and, of course, it wasn't THE book, THE LOVE HYPOTHESIS. No, it was this other book: LOVE ON THE BRAIN.**Note: I actually thought that the guy on this cover was the same guy as the guy on the first cover, and that he'd ditched the heroine from the first book and moved on to some purple haired wench and I was like, WELL, THAT'S GUTSY. But no. Different guy.After finishing this book, I have a LOT of THOUGHTS. And as I do with a lot of hyped books, I've decided to bullet point my likes and dislikes because I am nothing if not organized (JK, this is a lie) and it helps me substantiate my already wishy-washy rating system.
LIKES:
👍 Heroines in STEM. As someone who works in STEM, it's honestly so great to see more female characters-- especially in romance novels-- with jobs that they feel passionately about, which were (and still are!) typically thought of as careers for men. Ask someone to draw a doctor, and they usually draw you a dude. But I feel like having media like this throws a wrench in the infrastructural sexism gears, and also inspires women and young girls to pursue careers in math, science, tech, and engineering.👍 We stan a beta cinnamon roll hero of a man. Levi was actually really sweet. Well, once you got to know him. In the beginning of the book, I was like HOW ARE YOU GOING TO REDEEM THIS FOOL? But the author then proceeded to do a lot of legwork doing exactly that, and I was like, ""Well, okay, I guess I'll allow this.""  If Disney had a vegan doctor as a prince, Levi would be that prince.👍 All that neuroscience stuff. I majored in psychology, which is basically neuroscience's lazy older sister. I even took some intro neuroanatomy and neuroscience courses as part of my upper division requirements (and I worked in a research lab-- briefly!). So this was fun.👍 The writing was actually, mostly, decent? I don't know, based on what some people were saying, I was expecting Fifty Shades of Wattpad. But this was pretty breezy and easy to read. I finished it in just a few hours, even though it's almost 400 pages. 👍 Rocio and Kay. Who knew that I'd ship Wednesday Addams and Elle Woods together as a sapphic couple? Not me. But it totally works.DISLIKES:👎 The size kink. I did not need to hear how ridiculously-big-huge-too-freakishly-tall-for-space Levi was and how teeny-tiny-carry-her-in-your-pocket-smol Bee was every other page. Every time she sees him, she's just like HUGE. It was honestly ridiculous. I think part of the reason this sort of fetishizing annoys me is that it's skewed towards small/petite women only, and feels like it's propagating the stereotype that women have to be small and dainty and feminine to be worthy or beautiful. To illustrate how ridiculous this sort of pairing is, visually, I'm almost six feet tall. So I'd have to be with a dude who's like 7ft taller or higher to achieve this vibe.👎 Bee is like a walking Tumblr meme after it's had three Red Bulls. Look, I'm feminist, I'm liberal, I care about social issues. I'm a bit of a walking stereotype. But OH MY GOD. Bee IS the stereotype, wearing dyed pink hair. She felt like a meme of a person. Like a Meg Cabot character if it had gone to UC Berkeley. She was just too twee and it was way too much. Also, WHY are her only hobbies fangirling about Marie Curie, hating on men for not letting women science, and being vegan? She's obnoxious about all three of these things, btw. Especially the vegan one. Yikes.👎 La Llorona. I'm still not sure what the deal with this was.👎 Everything sucks and is on fire when you're a woman in STEM. It's so weird that these books are being branded as STEMinist and hailed for being uplifting because literally all the dudes in this book were SO AWFUL to Bee except Levi (and even he was awful at first). The lab did not feel at all fun and I feel like Bee's passion for neuroscience was often obscured by the frustration she felt at her work environment and co-workers. Which is valid but also kind of miserable.As for the things that I feel neutral about: the ending. It was fine. I saw a lot of people hating on it but I didn't see the twist coming so that was neat. I also liked the cats. I thought Bee's fainting disorder was a little weirdly portrayed, and felt like another way she was kind of hyper-feminized (she's petite AND she swoons, what is she, a Victorian waif?), but since I don't have this condition, I can't say how accurate it was. I'm also not really sure how I felt about Levi's family being portrayed as this military-obsessed cult, but I guess it makes sense for why he is the way he is. Still weird but I didn't care. Also, that three-page GRE rant was definitely soap-boxing and it felt kind of weird to see it just thrown into this romance novel, like someone trying to reach the word count on a last-minute essay. I'm okay with a little bit of soap-boxing but this felt really preachy and contrived, and I didn't really like that, because the dialogue didn't really fit into the context of what was going on, and therefore felt forced.In conclusion, I feel like Ali Hazelwood is a perfectly acceptable, perfectly average romance author who seems to get a disproportionate amount of hate for what she sets out to do. I'm not really in love with her writing despite being in the target audiences, and boy, does her self-insert main have a lot of utterly annoying quirks, but as a romance, I've read way worse-- this, at least, didn't leave me with a bad taste in my mouth. It turns out gratuitous cats can buy a lot of goodwill on my end.That doesn't mean I'm not still picturing Levi as a big tree trunk of a man with hams for hands, though.2.5 stars"
118,3,Love on the Brain,Ali Hazelwood,118,2023-03-11,megs_bookrack,5,"**4.5-stars rounded up**The Queen of Steamy-STEM is back and she's done it again!! Without putting too fine a point on it, I'll just say that Hazelwood's stories are the romances of my dreams. I loved this one even more than The Love Hypothesis.In Love on the Brain the Reader is introduced to Bee Königswasser, a neuroscientist, who has just been offered the opportunity to work on the project of her dreams for none other than NASA.Moving to Houston, Bee gets to bring along her dark-ray of moonshine assistant, Rocío, who contributes her own brand of humor to the story. The project is set to run for 3-months, which could turn out to be the greatest 3-months of Bee's career thus far. She's pumped to get started.Then Bee discovers her co-lead on the project is Levi Ward. Ughhhh, way to ruin an entire vibe. Levi is a huge jerk who spurned her at every turn in grad school.Bee never really understood what his deal was with her, but she knows she doesn't want to repeat any of it at this point in her life.Unsurprisingly, as Bee and Rocío attempt to settle in at their new office and get to work, it seems that someone is sabotaging them. Honestly, it's like Levi isn't even trying to hide it, but the longer they're around each other, Bee begins to see a different side to him. Is Levi softening towards her, or was she possibly misreading him all along? Also, if it isn't Levi sabotaging her, who is it?Y'all, I adored this story. From the very first moments in Bee's perspective, I knew I was going to become so connected to her. I adored the way her brain worked, her passions, her backstory, her insecurities, it was all so solidly developed.Then there is Levi, the epitome of a leading man. He's handsome, smart, industrious, athletic, motivated, charming, sweet and a Star Wars fan. I mean, sign me up.I love an Enemies-to-Lovers trope, so I wasn't surprised that I enjoyed this plot. One thing I really appreciated was that most of the miscommunication between the couple is cleared up earlier in the book than is generally the case.This allowed a better building of their relationship in my opinion. Usually you spend so much time just trying to have characters actually communicate with one another, it can get frustrating. I didn't really feel that here. It felt like just the right amount to build tension without causing annoyance.I also really loved the side characters, particularly Rocío, Bee's assistant, and Levi's cat, Schrodinger, because who doesn't love the cats who star in romance stories!?I will say towards the end, there was some silly drama that felt very eye-rolly for me, hence the 4.5-stars rounded up, versus a full-5. With that being said though, that's a pretty minor thing and it was the only time where I was sort of shaken out of the hypnotic trance this story put me in.I have read all of Hazelwood's currently published works and I have enjoyed them all. I love that she is shining a spotlight on women in STEM and that her characters are all so robust and likable.As with many Romance stories, there is a formula to them, but hey, they work. You know what you are getting into when you pick up a Hazelwood book and I'm here for it all the way.Thank you so much to the publisher, Berkley, for providing me with a copy to read and review. This is my favorite Hazelwood yet and I cannot wait to see what she has in store for us next!!"
119,3,Love on the Brain,Ali Hazelwood,119,2022-04-02,romancelibrary,4,"I received an ARC from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.Love on the Brain is a workplace romance between two rivals who are now co-leading a project together at NASA...with a You've Got Mail twist 😉Ali Hazelwood is really good at setting up her story and characters in a way that builds your anticipation from the very first chapter. Once again, I was hooked from the very beginning, simply dying for Levi and Bee to reunite. I don't want to compare this book too much to The Love Hypothesis, but there are some parallels here and there because both stories are set in the STEM world. There's also some delicious unrequited love on Levi's side which makes his interactions with Bee that much more exciting to read. Of course, Bee is completely unaware that Levi is in love with her. I don't know about you, but I just love the fresh scent of a pining hero 😏 If you loved Adam, then you are most likely going to love Levi as well. In fact, Levi is a lot more talkative than Adam, so I feel like I know him as well as I know our narrator, Bee.There's a solid set of supporting characters, but oh my goodness, Bee's research assistant is supremely annoying. Her humour was just not for me. I kept rolling my eyes whenever she showed up. The hero and heroine were both great, but I couldn't bring myself to be interested in the supporting characters.I really enjoyed Levi and Bee and I loved their development from so-called nemeses to friends to lovers. The plot is interesting, even though the science and engineering stuff went right over my head. But it's okay, I just know that their work is super important for astronauts 😂 The final conflict was majorly stressful, so major points to the author for actually making me question how the heck everything would be resolved. The climax was a bit too dramatic for me, but the epilogue was perfect!I will honestly read anything Ali Hazelwood publishes. I love her brand of romantic comedy and I can't wait for her next book!"

But I loved this. Full disclosure, I'm a huge fan of friends to lovers and second chance romance, and this features both of those tropes but does it so well. From the past to the present this was a beautiful love story with characters I fell in love with. Just so dang good. If you like Emily Henry, this is right up your alley."

”Love and Other Words rip-off with a BONUS trope: CHEATING 😍
yeah that’s how i’d market this. hire me, Berkley.0.5  added bc the dry humping / tiddy sucking scene in his car was hotHate:- the chapters felt draggy- didn’t even bother to compare this to LAOW but it was just too similar that i risked a stroke from constantly cringing - the cheating drama (we’ll get to that in a sec) Like:- the dialogues were cute. not sure abt the characters though lol- Sam being a tidy-freak and a hot nerd (my kryptonite)hmm…i think that’s it SPOILERS ‼️.....listen…. not that i’m ok with her cheating with his brother or anything but Charlie was kinda HOT. it took me some time to see that but personally, i would’ve gone for him when he first kissed her instead of Sam. Charlie’s 100% way more fun and interesting so i want his book asap 💥💳💥💳🚩how the cheating went down:—> Sam was offered to study somewhere far and didn’t tell Percy bc he didn’t want her to worry —> Percy got sad when she found out and felt like he didn’t care abt her or their relationship —> LDR began and Sam was stressed with school and had less time to talk to Percy —> Sam got even more stressed with school and suggested that they take a break from each other so he can focus on himself and achieve his dream - he told her this—> Percy got upset and didn’t respond to him —> Percy confided in Charlie (Sam’s bro) and soon found out that Charlie actually sorta has a crush on her —> Percy reciprocated when he flirted and decided to fuck him bc she was desperate to feel needed and desired. yes, and she was VERY sober (even better - Charlie was her first)me, reading this chapter:—> Percy then immediately regretted it the next morning lol ~end scene~let focus on the fact that the ENTIRE time she was flirting back and making out with Charlie, Sam didn’t cross Percy’s mind even for A MILLISECOND. she kept claiming how he was the love of her life and whatnot but with one single heartbreak, suddenly it’s like Sam didn’t even exist to her.People are so easy to forgive her but i bet my ass that if roles were reversed yall would’ve been raging!!! Imagine if it were Sam who slept with Percy’s sister bc “he wasn’t getting any attention or validation” from Percy while she was far away from home, struggling in school to chase her dreams. oh yeah, it’s totally ok bc he was feeling really lonely and unwanted huh :’ci mean Percy hasn’t been calling him and was too focused on school instead of their relationship so his decision to fuck her sister would TOTALLY be understandable, riiight?seriously…just sit and actually THINK. 
My LAST STRAW
: Sam apologizing and said that it was his fault that she cheated…WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?!?!? not my bro gaslighting himself 😭😭😭 just imagine if it was the girl apologizing for not giving enough love and attention to her boyfriend who cheated on her with her sister…*sighs* 😞😔so anyway…to sir Charlie"
126,4,Every Summer After,Carley Fortune,126,2022-08-05,SK,3,"""I loved you.""""I know.""""You broke my heart.""""I know that too."" This was a decent read yet, it had its ups and downs. I laughed in some places, cried in others. Loved it in some places, hated in others. I know, it's a bit confusing but hear me out...The book starts off really well. Giving such perfect relaxing summer vibes. The pacing stays consistent throughout the book- slow. I did not mind that much cause it kept me interested enough. The book somewhere along the middle drifted towards lot of drama. I didn't dread it, but I wasn't a fan of it either. It drag on a bit too much. The books is 70% flashbacks and 30% in the present. I personally would have preferred it to be more in the ""now"". The characters are  not  complex and I find them to be messy. Our FMC- Percy, is our Meredith Grey's version of  ""pick me. Choose me. Love me.""  Percy is also a pushover and it's not until the latter half of the book we see her stand up for herself (a little). Even in her thirties, she has a bit of immaturity about herself.  ""But am such a mess. And he's a doctor.""  Honestly, that's very unlikable sort of thinking. I can see why that kind of personality would not work for many readers, there were times when she annoyed me but it didn't bother me much. Sam knows how to be charming but at the same time he knows how to be a jerk. And he doesn't know how to change that about himself. He gives mixed signals but expects Percy to always be there for him. It was so frustrating to read. I did however like this quote from him,  ""You and me are special. There’s no one else I’d rather spend time with than you. There’s no one else I’d rather talk to than you. And there’s no one else I’d rather kiss than you.""  Charles or Charlie, Sam's brother was quite likable and had that sort of flirty nature to him. I did not mind his personality. The only character development in this book was of Delilah. She turned out to be a better friend than I was expecting her to be. ❌ POTENTIAL MINOR SPOILERS❌The ""big"" reveal wasn't big. I saw it coming ages ago, and I was immensely disappointed. I loathe the  cheating trope  and when that was revealed, it immediately took a lot away from the book (in my opinion). And it was brushed away within a few passages. If you're going to be dramatic throughout the book, give me more drama for that as well. If you're still going to be together, give me an apt communication for that. I do hold all three main characters accountable, especially the one who cheated. If you all can get past all of this, you should give it a shot. Otherwise, you're not missing out on something great. ⚠️Trigger warnings- Cheating, death of a loved one, grief.⚠️ "
127,4,Every Summer After,Carley Fortune,127,2022-05-11,Melissa (Hiatus for Work-Will Pop In When I Can)),2,"Outlier alert! Let me start out by saying that there are many great reviews for this book, so if the synopsis appeals to you, go read those reviews and take mine with a grain of salt. One of the reasons this book didn't connect with me was that I just got finished reading another coming of age novel (Our Little World ) which I thought was much better and rang more authentic, so I couldn't help but compare.This is a story told in two timelines: When Persephone is thirteen, her parents buy a lake house on Barry's Bay and she meets brothers Sam and Charlie, and they become friends. Sam and Percy develop a very close friendship over the years, which eventually turns to romance. Something happens that splinters the relationship and Sam and Percy haven't spoken for twelve years. Until Charlie calls with the news that their mother has died, and since she was like a second mom to Percy over the years, Percy returns to Barry's Bay for the funeral and to see Sam again.The Canadian setting is fantastic and well described. I got a real sense of place with this book and would love to visit the places the author talks about.What didn't really work for me:So much of this book feels like a really bad YA novel. The dialogue is stilted and unrealistic, and I realize that teenagers are super focused on sex but some of the scenes involving those situations were just cringey to me. Instead of talking about their feelings, everyone is jumping into bed at the slightest provocation (even as adults). I could never get a real sense of the time period. If the present day was really the present day, then Sam would have gone to college in 2010. Why was she calling him on the ""dorm phone""--why didn't he have a cell phone? She mentions texting a little bit and email, but it felt off the with the way they were communicating with each other. I called the ""big twist"" way before it was revealed, I know that others might like that the author waited until 80% into the book to reveal it, but it felt to me as if it was drawn out for longer than it needed to. Plus...anyone who has read my reviews knows how I feel about  cheating. Blah. Overall, I don't feel like I read the same book as everyone else who adored it. I didn't connect with the characters and got alternately bored and annoyed with them throughout the book. You may like this if you're looking for a beach read, and I'm definitely the outlier because many of my trusted reviewer friends loved it. I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book, all opinions are my own. "
128,4,Every Summer After,Carley Fortune,128,2023-02-17,MarilynW,4,"Every Summer After by Carley FortuneI love the cover of this book because that's how it starts, a boy and a girl, thirteen years old, meet and become best friends, spending holidays and summers together, thinking of each other when they aren't with each other. They even wear friendship bracelets that Percy made, Sam never takes his off. I felt like their two houses, next door to each other, were real places that I could actually visit. That I could walk out of either door and walk down to the docks and jump into the lake. Sam and Percy meet when Percy's parents buy the lake cabin next door to the house where Sam lives year round, with his mom and his brother, Charlie. Percy wants to be a writer someday and Sam reads what she writes and encourages her to keep on writing. Sam wants to be a doctor someday, driven by the cardio problems that caused his father's early death. Then there is Charlie, two years older than Sam, always wise cracking, always with a girlfriend or two or three. But something happened when Sam and Percy were eighteen and they never spoke again. Now, twelve years later, Sam and Charlie's mom has died and Charlie has asked her to come to the funeral. Percy loved their mother, she was like a second mother to her, so she goes back to Barry Bay, despite the fact that she is going to see Sam again. She needs to apologize to him for what she did that caused her to walk away from him. The guilt has been with her all these years and she knows she needs to confess to him what she's done. The story starts with the present and then takes us back over the six years that Sam and Percy had together as best friends and more. We go back and forth from the present to those six years where we watch their relationship evolve, until it falls apart, leaving Percy shattered and unable to have a meaningful relationship with anyone else. Sam, Charlie, and Percy seem so real and my heart ached for them. The alternating timelines worked very well here and I didn't even mind that there was this big secret of Percy's that isn't revealed to us until almost the end of the story. This is about friendship, romance, and family and about not ever being able to let go. It's a very satisfying story and it felt so very real.Pub May 10, 2022Thank you to Berkley and NetGalley for this ARC."
129,4,Every Summer After,Carley Fortune,129,2022-08-11,Madita,2,"2 stars:I loved loved the flashbacks,I hated the plottwist and Percy’s biggest regret,I did not enjoy the ending at all especially cause it was so fast paced,Sam and Percy should not have ended up together I get that people will like forgive and forget things loved ones did to them but Sam deserved better. I know why Percy ended up in that situation in the first place but I am not even going to lie, that’s no excuse and it was excused.Sam was wayyyyyy too eager but his emails made sense on what he wanted to focus on. Charlie annoyed me throughout the entire book and I did not know how to feel about Percy’s best friend. I was really confused on what the plottwist was going to be and it ruined Percy’s character for me and any good things I liked and praised about her. I don’t get Sam and why he forgave her especially after sooooo many years."
130,4,Every Summer After,Carley Fortune,130,2022-05-10,Kat *will catch up soon!*,5,"I had a feeling when I first saw the cover for this, I was going to love it. I wasn’t prepared for just how much! I think I left a piece of my heart on every page!Breathtaking, emotional, vulnerable, tender, intense, beautiful, funny and oh so REAL - those are just some of the words I’d use to describe this stunning debut novel from Carley Fortune, and even then I can’t do it justice. I felt every moment of this book. I smiled, I laughed, my heart raced, sometimes it truly hurt, but at every single moment I was experiencing this book as if I was there, and it’s such a rare book that takes me to that place. Percy (Persephone) Fraser and Sam Florek meet when they’re 13-years old and her family buys a summer lake cottage in Barry’s Bay next to the one he lives in year-round with his mom, Sue, and older brother, Charlie. They become best friends, spending summers and holidays together each year until Percy returns to Toronto for school. Her independence and wit complement Sam’s intelligence and sensitivity, and together they bond over her writing and love of horror movies, swimming, working together at Sue’s restaurant, and their ritual “three updates” they offer one another every time they talk after an absence. For six summers their friendship evolves and deepens until their future looks clear … until something happens and it isn’t. Now, Percy, who’s returned to Barry’s Bay 12-years after last seeing Sam, wonders if she’s destroyed that future forever.This is a story about love, friendship and all the messiness that comes with it. Because it switches back and forth between the past and present, and a large chunk of the book is retelling the events of those six summers as teenagers, you might wonder if it reads YA. It doesn’t, even though there’s a coming of age element. It’s refreshingly mature, and I ADORED Percy and Sam, both as teens and as adults. Their friendship was so utterly charming, and I wanted all the good things for them both! The past timeline captures the curiosity, confusion and hunger of being young and seeing friendship become something more, and the present one explores what happens when love has to find its way back. I’ll give fair warning that the story doesn’t hold back on the ‘relational’ details, so you might be blushing your way through parts! If you love a character-rich, emotionally evocative, BEAUTIFULLY written story that explores what love feels like, both good and bad, this is one you won’t want to miss! It will definitely be in my all-time favorites, and there would have to be something truly stellar to surpass it as my favorite book for this year! ★★★★★ (5 glowing, heart-quivering stars) ❤ Thanks to Berkley Publishing Group, NetGalley, and author Carley Fortune for this ARC. My opinions have been given freely and honestly. This will be published May 10, 2022."

When I read the blurb: I was so sure Sam and Percy will be my ruin! Literally my eyes cried out! I barely opened my eyes to read last chapters!This is effective blend of betrayal, longing, lies, secrets, anxiety issues, grief with well developed character and truly well written angsty- tear jerker! 12 years long story is perfectly told by moving us back and forth between past and present to understand more about mistakes, resentments, unresolved issues of those two lovers! I’m so happy to be introduced with brand new author who knows how to make me cry so loud! My emotions are absolutely everywhere!I was so close to five stars! The reason why I didn’t: I truly wished to read events from Sam’s perspective! It may give us more realistic approach to lovers’ story! But overall: I truly loved this book and ai highly recommend it!

133,4,Every Summer After,Carley Fortune,133,2022-05-12,Monica,2,"1.5 ✨ This may be a case of false marketing, but I’m still mad about it regardless. I don’t want to take away from the people who loved this book and future readers who might love it as well, but I did not vibe with it at all. This book read like a YA novel. The “past” chapters/timeline was way more fleshed out, detailed, and poignant than the “now” chapters/timelines. With that in mind, I didn’t mind reading about 13 year olds having harmless crushes at first for the sake of the trope, but when what felt like 75% of the book was reading from a horny teenager’s perspective as the book went on, adult me was actually pretty uncomfortable with it. “Coming of age” is a tag. Where? Where was the character development? What happened that either of these characters “came of age?” None whatsoever. Speaking of character development, there wasn’t any. In this entire 300-page novel, we get no growth. Only SEVENTEEN YEARS OF MISCOMMUNICATION. Do you know how infuriating that is? It’s brutal. Persephone (“Percy”) is the same as she was at thirteen and at thirty. Can’t have a conversation with her “the one.” I can’t. Please. If you can’t even have some sort of conversation, how can you actually truly make that work? Unbelievable. Don’t even get me started one the TWIST. I saw this from the very first interactions the characters had. It’s clear as day. Even so, I am ANGRY that the author chose to go this direction. And I’m even ANGRIER that reconciliation was hmm, idk, 4 pages and then we get an epilogue and a HEA? Way too much painful, irrelevant build up and not enough pay off. Sam, the love interest, was the saving grace of this book but adult Sam is an idiot. for the reviewers that mentioned this book is reminiscent of Love and Other Words, you were not wrong. We have the same sort of set up but with a few different variables. I was hoping for a fresh take on the childhood friends to lovers to strangers to lovers, but we barely got any character time with them as adults. It literally takes place over 2 days. This didn’t feel like a “second chance” romance because the second chance took place over 1 barely-there chapter and they barely spoke about THE THING that caused them to stop talking. Instead of focusing on all the before, I wish we got the angst of their early 20’s instead of all the early adolescent uncomfortableness. And then had an actual second chance. Not a *poof* HEA after 1 conversation. I feel robbed. 1.5 stars because the writing was really well done. As a debut novel, Carley really captured the setting and (albeit annoying) voice of Percy. I’ll keep an open mind on future books because her writing was really easy to read and get into. I just hated the execution. ——I need to sleep on this before I rate it. I don’t know how I feel about it. ——Apparently this is reminiscent of Love and Other Words so I immediately preordered it 😌"
134,4,Every Summer After,Carley Fortune,134,2022-07-19,Ali Goodwin,4,"4.5 stars!! Sooo good! I literally could not put it down. Perfect if you're looking for a summer romance. It takes place over 6 summers at a lake house. And it's childhood friends to lovers which I love! I do have 2 complaints and am so sad this wasn't a 5 star read for me because it almost almost was. Firstly, the ending wasn't my favorite. It made me kind of dislike the main character. And secondly this book is SO similar to Love and Other Words by Christina Lauren in overall plot and in little details. It really surprised me how similar they were. I totally understand there are only so many romance tropes, plot points, etc. but at certain parts I kind of felt like I was rereading L&OW. Overall though I LOVED this book. Please add it to your TBR!!"
135,4,Every Summer After,Carley Fortune,135,2022-06-13,Tina,4,Another great Canadian alert! 🇨🇦 Kudos to Carley Fortune and her debut novel.This is the perfect summer read that will bring out nostalgic memories for some. I just love this particular cover (although both covers are fab!) ☀️This is a coming-of-age type of romance novel. Did it feel a bit YA?...yes in parts but it worked for me.Persephone Fraser (otherwise known as Percy) and Sam Florek meet at 13 years of age when Percy's parents purchase the cottage next door to Sam's home. The story goes back and forth in time from the past to the present. In the past time setting we see how Percy and Sam meet and spend 6 summers together falling in love. Something happens when they are 18 years old and they no longer speak to each other. In the present time Sam's mother has died and Percy is called back to the lake town for her funeral. They have not seen each other for 12 years at this point.What a refreshing change to read about a Canadian setting in Eastern Ontario's cottage country. I want to visit Barry's Bay in the summer and find a tavern that serves homemade pierogis! 😋 The author grew up in the area and now spends some time there every summer with her family. The nostalgia and love comes alive vividly in her writing. The twist was a little predictable but still a very enjoyable and entertaining book. I'd like to thank NetGalley and Penguin Random House Canada for granting me access to this Advance Reader Copy.
136,4,Every Summer After,Carley Fortune,136,2022-05-08,Larissa Cambusano,4,"4.5 ⭐️ second chance, childhood friends to lovers, and a summer read? count me in. immediately. Love and Other Words + The Summer I Turned Pretty + People We Meet On Vacation = THIS BOOK. now I will say, the first 90% was ASTONISHING & leading me to a 5 star… but the conflict at the end pissed me off to no end. I hated what happened and how it happened. It also felt very rushed??? and justice for my baby Delilah 🫶🏻But I loved Sam & Percy so much!!! although they both annoyed me at certain points. Overall, it was a great read. “I’ve tried to forget about you for more than ten years, but I don’t want to try anymore.” <3 "
137,4,Every Summer After,Carley Fortune,137,2022-07-05,Karla Espinosa,5,"If I could give this book 10 stars I would!! This was hands down the best book I've read in what feels like months! When I bought this book I knew people were already loving it but I did not expect to love it as much as I did! More than just a good summer read this was a beautiful story about second chances and the love between two people that manages to stay intact even after not seeing each other for over a decade. This story is about childhood best friends that share a once in a lifetime connection from day one. However, Percy, the main character makes a huge mistake that leads to them ending not just their relationship but their friendship. The book does an amazing job of taking you through the past and the present. The past was all the summers that led up to their falling out at 17 years old. The present is them now at 30 years old being forced to reunite for the sad reason of someone special to both of them passing away. The reason for their falling out was kept a mystery throughout the book which made it impossible to put down! I could talk about this book for hours... lol I'm obsessed with this book! "
138,4,Every Summer After,Carley Fortune,138,2022-07-28,preoccupiedbybooks,2,"I need to think on my rating for this one.. The first half was an absolute joy to read, I was obsessed, but the end part was a mess and I didn't like the twist (which I saw coming and dreaded) and how little time was spent on the fall out and in the present day timeline.."
139,4,Every Summer After,Carley Fortune,139,2022-08-13,Cara,5,"Every Summer After by Carley Fortune was so good!!! Although, there were things I may have disagreed with, I still found this book worth a five star. I have seen some mixed reviews for this book, so I thought it was worth a shot to read, and i'm glad I did because it was too good to pass up. The biggest problem I had was the miscommunication, but it made it all the more enjoyable. With every single page, I found myself laughing, screaming, and smiling. There were sad parts along with this story, but I didn't cry. By all means, none of the characters were perfect, they each had their own flaws/quirks. This was my first book by Carley Fortune, but if she does write more books in the future, you best believe I WILL read them. Every Summer After does have spicy moments, so if you are uncomfortable with that kind of stuff, then maybe this book isn't for you. This book definitely gave off summer vibes. Let me be honest, the cover is what really drew me in to reading this book.""Periods aren't gross. They are part of human biology, and they are actually pretty cool if you think about it, they are basically the foundation of human life"".-Okay, this quote actually made me laugh a little bit. I totally agree that they are the foundation of human life, but if you are a female you will agree with me that there is absolutely nothing cool about them. ""Betrayals don't cancel each other out. They just hurt more"". Persephone ""Percy"" Fraser and Sam Florek have been inseparable since they were thirteen years old. Percy and Sam met at their family's cottages. Sam noticed that Percy had on a bracelet and thought it was so cool. Sam started questioning Percy about it, so Percy decided to make Sam a friendship bracelet. Ever since then they have been best friends, every time they made a promise to each other they tugged on each other's bracelet and said ""I swear"". Sam and Percy bonded over the lake, swimming, and horror movies. I loved their friendship, but when Sam realized he started to have a crush on Percy, I wish he would have just straight up told her instead of playing games. Six summers to fall in love. One moment to fall apart. A weekend to get it right. Every Summer After is told in the now and decades ago where Percy and Sam's friendship first started. They say you can never go home again, and for Persephone Fraser, ever since she made the biggest mistake of her life a decade ago, that has felt too true. Instead of spending glittering summers on the lake of her childhood, Percy spends them in an apartment in the city, going out with friends, and keeping everyone at a safe distance from her heart. One day, Percy receives a phone call from Charlie, Sam's brother, informing her that their mother passed away and Percy's invited to the funeral. Sue, Sam and Charlie's mom, was like a second mother to Percy. She always made her feel welcome, and always cooked the best food. For six summers, through hazy afternoons on the water and warm summer nights working in his family's restaurant and curling up together with books, Percy and Sam have been inseparable, until one summer night when Percy made the biggest mistake of her life. When Percy returns to the lake for Sam’s mother’s funeral, their connection is as undeniable as it had always been. But until Percy can confront the decisions she made and the years she’s spent punishing herself for them, they’ll never know whether their love might be bigger than the biggest mistakes of their past. In the now when Sam and Percy are talking in his family's restaurant a female comes out, Percy thinks it's one of Sam's cousins, but when introductions are made, it's then that Percy realizes Sam has a girlfriend. Percy never thought Sam would move on, but how can you be a hot doctor and not have a girlfriend? I wish this book had a summer playlist to follow along with while reading. I don't know, maybe it's just me but listening to music while reading is just golden. But, all in all I enjoyed this book. It was perfect for a summer read. "

141,4,Every Summer After,Carley Fortune,141,2022-08-17,Maren’s Reads,5,"What I wouldn’t give to be able to go back and read this one for the first time again. Every ounce of hype shown to this book is completely deserved. I loved just about every single minute of it and had the overwhelming feeling of not wanting it to end. Not only could I not put it down, I read into the wee hours of the morning until my eyes blurred over. There may or may not have been a book hangover involved. Basically this book left me a wreck in the best possible sense of the word. The only question I have after finishing this one is how on earth is this a debut novel?The depth and breathe of each of the central characters was phenomenal. From only a few pages in, I felt the intense connection between Percy and Sam, as well as the love and attachment each one had to their families. Although this book is told solely in first person narration from Percy’s perspective, Fortune did an excellent job at allowing us inside the head’s of Sam and Charlie as well. This foundation helped to create an even more emotional climax and a vested interest in the outcome. So many comparisons have been made between Every Summer After and Love & Other Words by Christina Lauren. While I love both, this is by far my favorite of the two. It had all of the passion, all of heartache, all of the yearning and young love, without the troublesome bits found in the latter. I don’t think there is more to be said then what has already been shared in the eight million reviews that have come before mine. Do yourself a favor and read this book. Sometimes, Bookstagram misses the mark. On this one, it definitely did not. "
142,4,Every Summer After,Carley Fortune,142,2022-05-11,Alina,1,"How can a book be so good and sweet until the last 10% and then everything turns into a car crash of epic proportions. I’m super disappointed and upset because I loved the childhood friendship between the hero and heroine and while I expected something big as the fallout, I didn’t expect that. I was utterly shocked and it made me sick to my stomach The ending is super rushed and doesn’t feel realistic because of that.I’m so disappointed "

There are similar elements in this book, and i think that’s largely what got me sooo excited to read it!The beginning is a little bit slow, took me a few chapters to get into it. But once I got into them, I was in it deep! The moment they reconnected in the beginning, I was flying through the book.It’s told in alternating timelines and you get to experience every summer they spent together leading up to their fallout. There are a lot of sweet moments between them, moments that made me smile and root for them. Their friendship bracelets 😭😭Percy’s parents have a summer cottage by the lake and every summer, the three of them go there to get away from the city and there happens to be a single mom with two kids next door. One of the boys, Sam, is the same age as her and the other one, Charlie, is a year or two older. So she and Sam end up spending a lot of time together, and something about friends to lovers just touches my heart 😩 I keep thinking of the little things they share with each other and istg it brings a smile to my face each time ❤️‍🔥There are, however, periods in the book that made me a little frustrated, but each chapter just spurred me forward until next thing I knew, I was almost done with the book. It was a one sitting read for me, just a little bit over 300. And that ending was just so touching 😭There are a few cons to the book, like some lull in pacing and I wish it would have been a dual POV because I would have loved to get into Sam’s head, but damn, I feel like this is a book I could easily reread."
146,4,Every Summer After,Carley Fortune,146,2022-05-30,Júlia,5,"TW: cheating, panic attacks, mental health talk, dealing with the loss of a parent, we defend women's rights but most importantly we also defend women's wrongs.    This is why I can't bring myself to DNF books. I picked this up, read 50% and fell asleep five times. I let it sit on my nightstand for over a week, just marinating, wondering if I was ever going to go back to it or just let it melt away next to my bed until I forgot about the entire plot and never picked it up again.  I am so glad I DIDN'T DO THAT.  This is going to be a hard one to tackle without giving you any spoilers, but I will do my best.  The first half was super slow. This is a slow book, with an Emily Henry and Christina Lauren style. If People We Meet on Vacation and Love and Other Words had a baby, this would be it.   The thing that initially annoyed me about this book was how similar it was to things that we have already read. They got together as teens, they were best friends and stopped talking for twelve years because of something that happened. The story is told by her between present and past shifts (and I am an absolute wh#re for present and past storytelling shifts, I am also an absolute wh#re for friends to lovers, so this is a winner) However, it wasn't a winner from the get-go.  It is extremely infuriating to me; to love a trope so much and just read more of the same being told with different names and different faces. Give me something new, give me angst, give me tension, so I was a bit unhappy during the first half.  Until I got to the second half of the book and the story started picking up, the characters became more vivid, their interactions more tense, the plot twist was awesome (even though it was quite predictable) it was incredibly emotional and honestly, understandable.  This is how you tell a second chance tale.  I don't know when it happened exactly, or how, but there was a moment where I wasn't bored anymore. I wasn't rolling my eyes at the page any longer, things started to make sense, I created a bond and a connection with these characters and every time Percy had a panic attack (your girl has a lot of those too so I relate) I was right there with her.  The imagery, the flow, the emotion and the overall rawness of how this story was told is what got me.  I found myself inside their minds, wanting to hug them all and tell them it was going to be ok.  Their teen angst, their first kisses and the first time she let it come out of her mouth she had feelings for him RUINED ME. All of their love scenes and conversations were so delicately written, ugh. So good.  The first half was well written, it was just slow.  This ended up differentiating itself quite a bit from Emily Henry's and Christina Lauren's stories at end, and it was thanks to how much personality these characters had. There were quite a few butterfly inducing scenes, and she didn't shy away from s&x in this book either. Everything was given to you in the right amount, at the right time.  This is what a well written book looks like and you can't tell me otherwise.   Just keep in mind that this is an emotional journey, filled with some heavy themes. I never cry while reading books, it wasn't a tear-jerker or anything (IMO) however, this will make your heart swell a little bit, not gonna lie.   This might not be everyone's cup of tea because of it's slow pace, themes and the tropes in this (I just personally love these) but we can't deny this is IMMACULATE story telling."

148,4,Every Summer After,Carley Fortune,148,2022-08-13,Jennifer ~ TarHeelReader,4,"In a nutshell, Every Summer After is the story of young love. Percy and Sam meet in their teens at the lake where Percy’s family spends their summers and Sam lives year round. They become best friends and slowly their love for one another builds. Slowly as in summer after summer.There’s also a present day storyline where Percy is visiting the lake because Sam’s mother has passed away. There’s a big secret about why she and Sam did not work out 10 years earlier, and only Percy knows why.Just as their past relationship is relayed as becoming more intimate, the present storyline also progresses in the same way.Every Summer After will have you remembering those butterflies of young, innocent first love. It also shows how just one decision can change the course of one’s life, but at the same time, time can heal.My favorite aspect of the story other than its high readability is the way Carley Fortune has drawn these characters, especially Percy and Sam. They are fallible but with huge hearts. It was refreshing to have a male main character who is sensitive, loving, and steadfast. I bought into his best friendship with Percy. I also loved the way mental health was highlighted. I could relate to Percy’s anxiety and how it affected her decision-making.Overall, this is a nostalgic, steamy story of summer love, family, and friendship, and I’m so grateful I read it.I received a gifted ecopy from the publisher, but I also purchased a physical copy for my shelf.

149,4,Every Summer After,Carley Fortune,149,2022-05-13,Jasmine,4,"Every Summer After is full of angst and yearning and characters not easily forgotten. After a night out in the city, Persephone Fraser receives a call that prompts her to return to Barry’s Bay, where she and her family used to spend every summer. Almost immediately, she runs into Sam Florek, her ex, her first love, the man she is still not over. Persephone, or Percy, her former nickname, first met Sam at the cottage when they were thirteen years old. For six years, they spent every summer and holiday together; they were inseparable. They spent their days swimming in the lake, running, working, and doing everything together. Over the years, their friendship evolved into something more, and they began looking toward their joined future. That is until something happened, and their relationship entirely fell apart. This coming-of-age/second-chance romance has dual timelines, which are equally compelling. It is very much a character-driven story. This book was so close to a five-star read. I don’t read many romance novels, but this one was thoroughly unputdownable. And when I had to set it down, I could not wait to get back to it. The first few chapters that outlined Percy’s present lifestyle didn’t interest me much. But, when she returned to Barry’s Bay, the chemistry between the two was unmatched. Plus, the author perfectly captured hot summer days spent at the lake. My only criticism would be that the ending wrapped up slightly too perfectly and felt rushed.Even if romance isn’t your go-to genre, I would still recommend this if you enjoy character-focused stories. At the time of writing this review, I finished reading this book several days ago, and I’m still swooning over Sam and Percy.

150,5,Things We Never Got Over,Lucy Score,150,2022-05-22,Júlia,2,"Be warned, if you love this book,  do not read this review. I am not showing it any mercy.  To say I had massive expectations is an understatement. I jumped into this knowing I was getting into a romcom. I was waiting for people we meet on vacation feels or Wall of Winnipeg swoons and I got a big pile of the most obnoxious, insufferable writing and plot devices I've seen in a looooong time.  This author managed to write the same book twice... inside of the same book. Does that make sense? Let's start with the fact that this was nearly 700 pages long and every time the main character POUTED because she needed caffeine, I wanted to live a little less.  I need to be fair... Some of the sex scenes were sweet, and this couple could have been cute. This book just had to be AT LEAST 300 pages shorter and the characters had to have a personality and the maturity of a normal human being and not sound like they were all 12. I don't think that is too much to ask, honestly.  This book managed to include every single thing I hate in romcoms, every-single-thing.  Leaving the EXTREMELY obnoxious, forced and stereotypical gay representation in this aside... Let's start with the fact that some authors just go overboard with their ""sunshine"" characters. Why does every sunshine woman need to be co-dependent? Why can't you write a NORMAL bubbly woman, who knows how to be a functional adult?  Nooooooo, but that's not stereotypical enough. A sunshine character is quirky!!! She loves coffee! She can't remember where she parked her car! She is so entertaining!! Did I mention she LOOOOOOOOOOVES coffee? Oh I didn't? Don't worry, the author will make her groan and pout 22 times while she's thinking about coffee before chapter 10, and that is just soooooooooo sexy.   We need to be done with the idea that bubbly women are stupid and helpless women. I can't relate to female characters like that. Have you ever met a woman? In what world would a woman not know what to do in a crisis situation?!  She cries to a complete stranger and asks him:  please, help me, what should I do?  5 times in the first two chapters. The fact that a 40 year old man finds a broken shell of a woman attractive is a red flag of its own.  There are so many things that annoyed the fuck out of me in this book, none of this plot made sense. None of this was down-to-earth, realistic, everything felt forced, all the jokes and the stereotyping were taken to a MAXIMUM.  Oh Julia, but it's fiction. Give it a rest. I have a list of romantic comedies with sunshine and grumpy characters that were written like a damn masterpiece. This one is just bad, I am sorry.  How do you expect me to find their childish bickering from chapter 1 attractive and sexy? The most mature character in this entire book was an 11 year old.   Honorable mentions to: ""I knew you'd have a ""fuck me body"" sentence that came out of our hero's mouth at some point during their first time.   She filled 700 pages with the same back and forth, multiple times, and I think 300 of those pages were inner dialogues of Knox being the most pathetic 40 year old I have ever met and our female lead thinking about coffee, orgasms or having chats with her gay best friend who knows everythinggggg about hair!!  Spare me.   This could have been an ok, sweet story if she just had dialed it down a notch, had not repeated herself 300 times and written normal, down-to-earth characters.  I am honestly annoyed at the misrepresentation of gay characters. I am sick of bubbly women being portrayed as stupid and helpless, I am sick of men's lack of emotional responsibility and maturity being down-played, forgiven easily and used as a plot device. (And I am a dark romance reader so that’s saying something)  This was a bad, boring, over-the-top stupid, over-hyped book.  Sorry, that is my brutally honest review.   It's ok if you liked this book. On a good day I can kind of see why, I feel bad for it, honestly. It just compiled every single thing I hate in romcoms  and threw it at me and I am pissed at it lol, so yeah, two PITY stars.  I did also hate  it happened one summer , another popular and loved book that people compare to this one a lot. Keep that in mind and take it with a grain a salt, this book might be for you! It’s just definitely not for me!"

152,5,Things We Never Got Over,Lucy Score,152,2022-03-31,pauline,5,"I GENUINELY CANNOT EXPRESS HOW MUCH I LOVED THIS BOOK?!?!?!!?Nearly two weeks after reading the book am I now writing the review and it’s safe to say I haven’t stopped thinking about it. I’M NOT EVEN KIDDING. I’m itching to pick up the book and flip through my tabbed pages and there’s A LOTTTTT. My guess would be over 150 tabs?!? Idk, give or take 🤷‍♀️This book came at a time where I was waiting for the next book to WOWWWW me, and mannnnn, did this not disappoint. I was hooked from the START!!!It’s always a struggle for me to start a book because there’s always that lull at the beginning when you’re getting to know the characters before you get invested, but I was into this from the START. And that’s how I usually know I’ll love the book, is when I’m invested by the end of the first chapter or the first few.IT IS SO FUCKING GOOD!! It’s grumpy sunshine, small romance, she finds out she has a niece she never knew while she has to waltz in and clean up her twin sister’s mess. FROM THE BEGINNING, YOU GET TO SEE HOW GRUMPY KNOX MORGAN IS. This man is soooooooo fucking hot oh my god, I can’t even write this sentence without feeling giddy and wanting to squeal!!I’m so in love with him, I fell in love with every single one of the characters, LITERALLY EVERY ONE (except a big fuck you to Tina), and the story just grips you from beginning to end.There is one particular character I instantly knew I needed a book from and that’s my baby Lucian!! The small snippets you see of him in this book is going to make you fall and fall hard. I hadn’t even finished the book at the time when I decided that he was gonna be my next obsession. (Ofc he’s gonna come second to Mr. Bearded Badboy Grumpy Knox Morgan because that man is everythiiiing)^ here’s how I picture Knox… you know that guy on TikTok with the axe who breaks apart those tree trunks??? THAT MAN???? In my head, that’s him 🤪 (If you don’t like fan casting, then just forget I said anything 😐)I thought I was deluding myself when I finished this book?! I thought to myself, “did I really love this??? Or was this just the first book I got excited for in what feels like a while??”NOPEEEEE. Two things can be true. It was the first book that left me feeling so excited AND I really loved it.There is a happily ever after, and not only do we get one epilogue, BUT ALSO A BONUS EPILOGUE. Seriously, in that bonus epilogue?!?!? With Way and Knox and the way they spoke to each other?! OH MY GOD MY HEART EXPLODED!!When I finish a book, I’m usually at a loss for how to review it especially when it’s been a while since I finished it, but I think this is one of my fastest written reviews lmaooooo. I just really loved this book and highly highly recommend it.It’s a pretty long book, about 500-600 pages (can’t remember) but it didn’t read that long to me at all. I got through it so quickly. I couldn’t put it down.There are just so many good parts in this book that I genuinely head-over-heels enjoyed. How grumpy this man is, the support he gives Naomi, the love and encouragement and pep talks he gave Way. UGH!!! ❤️‍🔥 I wanna read it again byeeee"

With an avg. rating of 4.72 it seems like I’m going to be the odd one again who can’t rate this more than 2.5 stars maxMe right after finishing Things We Never Got Over: 🤡 I think I’m going to rate this 3.5 stars and round it up to 4 stars 🤡, cause the book was cute after all and had a tons of tropes done well such as ☀️ sunshine runaway bride & grumpy bad boy barber/business owner🐶 a cute dog👵 a cool grandma👩‍👧 a newly single - mum who had guardianship of her 11 year old niece temporary, cause her twin sister stole her car, left town and left her daughter with her🧠 smart & funny kid🏡 small town vibes a.k.a tons of gossip & meddling folks🏠 forced proximity (mcs are neighbors)🍹 boss / employee💑 very supportive and loving parents from the heroine’s side💖 heroine has the best gay best friend (1. why are the male best friends in romance always gay if they are not the love interest? 2. he is in the mafia or what are those mysterious business calls he always has to take??? 3. where is Stef’s book??!)🔥 Hero has great hot friends too and a hot younger brother who is a cop (Lucian-sir spare me a hand in marriage?? Nash-daddy handcuff me to your bed???)all of this combined feels like a lovechild between Mariana Zapata and Kristen Ashley and makes for a great comfort book = happy Phuong. Me writing this review: Sooo this book is about Daisy (h) and Knox (H). *looks at the cover* well okay, Daisy just left her fiancée at the altar ...*accidentally clicks on the blurb* “Naomi wasn’t just running away from her wedding.” WHO THE FUCK IS NAOMI? *opens the book in panic to check the heroine’s chapter heading* “Chapter 1 Naomi” Oh... OHHH.. okay THAT’S her name, Knox calling her Daisy all the time was only an endearment I see, and it was because Dai-Naomi had flowers in her hair when he met her..oh now I get it. The fact that I only realized now that I had the heroine’s name wrong this whole time, it’s embarrassing ahahahaha. Just for that alone, I’m sorry I can’t give this book 4 stars with good conscious, even tho I had mostly a good time reading it, but if I can’t even recall the first name of the main character, I don’t know what else my fragile mind blocked out. 🕳️🏃🏻‍♀️
“Why are you whispering?” “Because he lives right there,” I said, pointing my glass in the direction of Knox’s cabin. “Oooh. Grumpy next-door neighbor. That’s one of my favorite tropes.” “The first time he met me, he called me trash.” “That bitch.” “Well, technically he thought I was Tina [the twin sister] when he was yelling at me in front of an entire cafe full of strangers.” “That vision-impaired bitch.” “God, I love you.” I sighed.
Don’t mind me inserting this random quote, I just love Stef. He is my spirit animal. Conclusion:Very cute book and I don’t have much to complain about beside that the first 20% didn’t rlly catch me as much as I hoped it would, but then the people of Knockemount grew on me. The heroine was too much of a goody two shoe for me sometimes, but not too bad that it would annoy me. Things We Never Got Over is not a story that will stay forever with me ahem🤡, but I honestly have a lot of good things to say about it, first and foremost all the side characters that carried this book like champs! Can’t wait to read Lucian and Sloane’s book!P.S. Not Lucy Score referencing her own book Rock Bottom Girl when Naomi needed to research about soccer 😭🤚I don't know if I find it endearing or lowkey embarrassing..the jury's still out, but most of all I wish I had that self-confidence lmao."

I don't understand how a man who ignores your wishes and opinions, belittles you, dismisses you, takes away your agency, physically grabs you and drags you around, intervenes in your business when he's not wanted, is controlling, is financially and emotionally abusive, snarls, growls, and uses his physicality to intimidate you is in ANY way a romantic lead. The number of strong reviews for this book and positive views of the main male character is truly disturbing. I mean, he even renames her! Her name isn't even good enough.

 “Naomi, this isn’t what I wanted.”
Just like the above sentence from this book, this isn't what readers like me too wanted. This was a strange book where the characters behaved in bizarre ways. The main characters, Naomi and Knox, are both above 35 years. Yet, they are  acting like irritating kindergarten kids who are obsessed with actions similar to Disney characters in some parts of the book and like toxic, emotionally manipulating, and stalking characters in the other parts. Character development is one of the most important aspects of a novel; the characters create and push the plot forward. I felt that this book's flawed character development sadly pulls the story backward.It looks like the author was totally confused about the mannerisms given to her characters. So she vacillates between polar opposite behaviors with a lot of unnecessary smut in unexpected, strange circumstances. There is a big difference between some banter and being toxic. To make things even worse this book has more than 500 pages. The blurb of this book looked promising, and many of my friends gave high ratings for it. So I read it cover to cover, hoping the author would revive it at some stage. But nothing happened even after the epilogue and the bonus epilogue. At last, it turned out to be a big disappointment."

165,5,Things We Never Got Over,Lucy Score,165,2022-08-08,READ ME ROMANCE,2,"I am writing this review with a heavy heart, because as fiercely as I loved the author’s other work, especially the Benevolence series, Bootleg Springs series, By a Thread, the Christmas Fix, the Worst Best Man, Rock Bottom Girl, etc., I felt the complete opposite after reading Things We Never Got Over. I generally do not include spoilers in my review, but am citing a few examples from the story to explain my low rating. If you don’t like spoilers, read no further.Knox Morgan our “hero” was anything but in my opinion. While I love an alpha and a growly grump with a squishy marshmallow center, I felt Knox was a condescending, self-righteous, steamrolling jerk. The story takes place in the small town of Knockemout, Virginia, where Knox lives in a cabin on the same property that he shares with his widowed grandmother. He’s 43 and won $11 million in the lottery a few years back which caused a rift between him and his only brother, Nash, the town’s chief of police, whom I adored. It wasn’t an argument over money, as Knox did offer him a generous share, it was how Knox reacted when Nash refused. Knox was arrogant and demeaning, and treated Nash horribly from beginning to end in my opinion. While not estranged, Knox obviously held resentments and needed professional help. Nash was a good man, level headed and honorable, and did not deserve it. We meet our heroine, Naomi, the day after she leaves her fiancé (for good reason) at the altar and blows into town in a whirlwind to help her evil twin sister, Tina. With a hopeful heart and generous spirit, Naomi once again falls into her trap and is blindsided by her wickedness as she stole her car and ransacked her hotel room. But her frown turned upside down when she was introduced to her adorable 11-year-old niece, Waylay, and agrees to become her guardian, even though she’s not sure how she will manage. When Knox meets Naomi at a local coffee shop, he believes she is her identical twin, causes a scene, and is anything but pleasant. I loved the sass she volleyed back to Knox and how easily she could read him and was not intimidated. Upon learning she is “not Tina” (her nickname did make me laugh), Knox offers to help her by belting out directives and taking her to an adorable cottage on his grandmother’s property. Naomi was ever so grateful and humble, and things were looking up as she was able to work out a deal with Liza J. Knox showed no respect to his brother when he officially came to investigate the break-in and car theft. The tension was so thick between the brothers that Knox egged Nash on and challenged him to a fight saying, “I saw her first.” Nash may have thrown the first punch, but after Knox punched his brother in the face, he internalized that “messing up Nash was always gratifying.” It was the first of several fistfights that Knox got into, which is a really big turn off for me. Naomi scored a job and didn’t realize it was at the local bar Knox owned. She was tired and nervous, as she never worked in the restaurant industry before, and instead of welcoming her, Knox humiliated her and demanded she “get out,” and that he “didn’t want her around.” He said, “I’m not working with some uppity, needy pain in the a$$.” This is the same woman who just had her whole life upended–and he knew this! She left her fiancé, quite her job, left her home, was missing her wallet, phone and car, taken responsibility for her niece, and was trying to start over, and he was such a crass a-hole. Even though she was a bit naive, Naomi was so sweet and had so much character. She tried her best to keep her composure, worked all night against his wishes to earn a few bucks, and then Knox had a change of heart asking her to stay. He was so hot and cold that it gave me whiplash. I feel Knox suffers from borderline personality disorder (fear of abandonment, unstable relationships, shifting self-image, impulsive, self-destructive, extreme emotional mood swings, chronic feelings of emptiness, and explosive anger.) He also possesses a narcissist’s grandiose sense of self-importance, which leads him to feel a sense of entitlement, and expects everyone to comply with his expectations without question. He was Jekyll and Hyde, gaslighting and mistreating her over and over and yet she still fell in love. Then breaks her heart and leaves...just like he said he would, and has the nerve to sulk! Out of concern Nash asked his brother as to why he broke things off, and Knox replied with, “Problem...with you helping yourself to my leftovers? Nah. Better she didn’t go to waste.” There wasn’t any romance unless you consider the time he offered to take her on a lunch date, then tossed a bagged PBJ onto her lap in his truck, convincing her to partake in an afternoon delight. Sadly, she was starry-eyed and lacked the confidence to kick him to the curb. Her life was constantly filled with drama and stress with her sister’s illegal activities, yet she remained cheerful, tried to do right by her niece planning activities to support her emotional health, all while working two jobs to become financially secure. Watching Waylay feel safe and loved for the first time in her life was really emotional. I was totally invested in their relationship and enjoyed how they got to know one another, were both hopeful for a brighter future, and dealt with Tina’s betrayal. They were victims and survivors, and I admired their strength, perseverance, and positive attitude. Naomi selflessly sold her wedding dress and used it to by her niece clothes, sold her home so she could buy a car, and agreed to clean and organize his grandmother’s house in exchange for rent. She was hardworking, resilient, and a go-getter, earning my total respect. And after Knox tossed Naomi and Waylay “like a discarded receipt he no longer needed,” she held her head high and repeatedly asked him to stop contacting her, but he didn’t respect her wishes and continued to stalk her. Then an incident happened with her sister, and he TOLD her they were getting back together. He never asked her, nor did he apologize, and to my great disappointment, she succumbed. I wish I could jump in the story and tell her that she doesn’t need Knox's scraps of affection and that she deserves better.This story does end with a HEA for the couple, and Knox did make an effort to change towards the end, but it was a little too late for me. We all have hang-ups, but it doesn’t mean we go through life as a jerk. I felt he was emotionally abusive, controlling, and passive-aggressive. Lucy Score is one of my favorite authors, and even though I did not care for the hero of this story, I will be continuing with the series and look forward to seeing who falls in love next in Knockemout. I really liked her friend Stef from home, Simone the local librarian, Nash, her parents, his grandmom, and the local townsfolk."
166,5,Things We Never Got Over,Lucy Score,166,2022-01-21,Anovelqueen ,5,"***4.5 STARS***This is my first book by Lucy Score but it will definitely not be my last.Naomi comes to the small town of Knockemout after leaving her fiancée at the alter and to come help her twin sister Tina. When she gets to town she realizes her sister had caused all kinds of hell in town and has a bad reputation. In fact she is thought to be her sister when she goes to the local cafe and Knox Morgan shows up to “escort” her out of town. The couple are thrown together and Naomi realizes that she has an eleven year old niece that she knew nothing about which ties her to the small town.Very well written. Excellent storytelling, pacing, banter and dialogue. I loved Knox. He is the grumpy gorgeous hunk that has sworn off relationships and it is fun watching him fall. The only drawback I had was the length. It was a long book. But it kept my attention.I highly recommend it."

168,5,Things We Never Got Over,Lucy Score,168,2022-06-16,Giorgia Reads,3," 2.5 stars  I’m gonna bullet point this review for brevity’s sake, because at this point, the general consensus is that everyone loved this book and made it a bestseller so they must have seen something in it that I didn’t. If you loved the book, don’t read this, because I honestly I hated it. • too long for what it actually contained. (spoiler alert, it was mostly sexy scenes which added nothing to the plot)If I read a 600 pages book I’m expecting it to tie all the issues nicely by the end of the book. To provide answers to all the questions and most importantly to show me true character growth. This book - did not.• I keep hearing this described as a grumpy/sunshine pairing when it comes to the hero and heroine and unless I forgot what that means I’m pretty sure (actually, I would bet my life on it) that the hero Knox, was not grumpy, he was an absolute a$$hole, nothing less, nothing more. When someone acts rude, and downright verbally abusive to someone else for no reason whatsoever and keeps going back and forth with this attitude- again - for no reason whatsoever, that’s not a grumpy person - to me grumpy is maybe someone a little surly, a little rude, a little, blunt and a little impatient when it comes to general human interaction - and their attitude is not restricted to any one person in particular but rather everyone they encounter. The hero in this book had no reason to behave the way he did and I was just put off by him for most of the book. Also considering his age (I don’t like to say that someone should act a certain way according to their age - because God knows I’m the poster child for do Not act your age, but for a 40 something man to be so…. immature and irrational, it majorly put me off, no, thank you) • The heroine, I liked her, but I would have loved to see her more settled into her own and knowing exactly who she is and what she wants by the end of the book. She does make some decisions but I still feel like she lets the events that happened to her and the people in her life derail most of her individual and personal decisions. • the last point I’m gonna make but not necessarily the last thing that troubled me in this book, is that the heroine’s niece wasn’t given the proper story act that she needed. That was a child that was abandoned and she definitely had issues because of it - it’s just not possible otherwise and yet it felt like that whole situation was just used to give us an intro into the story but it wasn’t explored with the respect and dedication it needed to be. I actually would have loved to see that part play out, and I thought it was going to after reading the synopsis- but instead this veered into completely different grounds.So why did I give it 3 stars? Because I think it’s well written and it could be an overall a good time for most people, objectively, this wasn’t an awful book, it definitely wasn’t what I would consider a good story but the elements were there. In conclusion, I didn’t buy into the hype of this book. Do I get it? Yes, it does have a small town vibe, a hero who acts like an a$$ and a heroine who is trying her best and is a genuinely nice person. But is this worth the praises I’ve heard? Absolutely not. There are loads of books with this trope which have done it better and in less pages but are unfortunately not as popular."

Mam też ogromny zarzut do stylu autorki/tłumaczenia. ""To co zostaje w nas na zawsze"" jest napisane jakby autorką była piętnastolatka.

“You get to decide how you show up in this world. No one else gets to dictate to you who you are,”
I’ve read several Lucy Score books but this is by far the best I’ve read yet! I had such a good time reading this story. It was the perfect mix of fun, sweet, emotional, and just a bit suspenseful. Naomi and Knox have an interesting meet cute. When Naomi rolls into town with daisies in her hair she doesn’t expect the welcome she gets. See, her twin sister who is basically a menace to the town, asks for her help. When Naomi shows, she is, of course, mistaken for the twin. That lasts for a bit but ultimately she carves her own place out in town, along with her niece who she’s taking care of.Naomi was fantastic and warmed up to everyone fast, aside from Knox. I loved their banter and even when they were back and forth you could tell they both had it bad for one another. I loved seeing them fall for one another. Knox was fantastic as well. This was one of those books I didn’t want to stop listening to. It was 16 hours long and I listened to it in a day and a half! If you’re a fan of Kristen Ashley’s older books (think the CM series) this book gave off those same vibes. The story was different, but it gave me the same kind of feelings, as well as having epic secondary characters. I highly recommend this one and really hope Score gives us some more books, specifically Nash’s!

171,5,Things We Never Got Over,Lucy Score,171,2023-01-16,isy | yuvi's wife,2,"I saw a video saying this book was copaganda and suddenly everything makes more sense 💀Okay, so I really need to stop taking book recs from certain people.I don't even really want to talk about this book a lot, so I'm just going to list what I didn't like:-How the days worked? She would wake up, have a giant ass cup of coffee, do one activity, be exhausted, go to sleep, and then it was the next day, BUT she would pick up the kid from the bus from the day before. I don't know if that made sense, but that's the thing, IT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE. So basically, my explanation is perfect.-Coffee was this girl's ENTIRE personality for most of the book. I don't mind characters having an obsession with a food or drink, but when it's ALL they talk about, think about, or go get, it's ANNOYING.-This eleven-year-old was acting like a seventeen-year-old which I understand to a certain point since she kinda raised herself and was on her own, BUT the way she talked is what annoyed me the most. Kids can be more mature, but it should still show that they are a child through their speech mannerisms.-I didn't really like Knox. I don't really have anything to say about him. He didn't stand out, was bland, was an idiot (LIKE FRL), and pissed me off.-The ""climax"" with the sister and her boyfriend was so unrealistic I was dying laughing. And not in a good way 💀-The pacing was not for me. It was very insta-lovey just without them admitting it. I didn't feel the tension the characters were apparently experiencing and that really just turns me off the book. IF I DON'T FEEL THE TENSION, I DON'T WANT IT :)-Finally, the repetition. Oh my god, the amount of times I read that this girl always took care of others and didn't take the time to see what she wanted or needed, was the most infuriating thing EVER.Honestly, I should have DNFed because even the scenes I was looking forward to in the book (the ones promoting it on TikTok, you guys know what I mean) were a letdown. 2.5 stars for some of the spice scenes and the two scenes that made me smile."

“Barf,” Waylay complained.
 You and me both, Waylay.Naomi Witt is a runaway bride who left her would-be husband at the altar and, for some reason, decided to run straight to her Very Evil twin sister in the podunk town of Knockemout (Knock 'Em Out), Virginia. Evil Twin Sister then steals Naomi's car and money leaving poor Naomi stuck in Knockemout. Evil Twin Sister has apparently managed to piss off the entirety of Knockemout, despite only living there for a year, and so everyone hates Naomi at first sight. But Naomi is beautiful and perfect and friendly and amazing, so she quickly wins everyone over, except for Grumpy Bad Boy Knox Morgan. This is a TropeTastic book–mistaken identity, enemies to lovers, forced proximity, fake dating, good girl/bad boy, and grumpy x sunshine are all of the tropes that I can think of off the top of my head. And the book suffered for it. The only reason this book needed to be almost 600 pages was so the author could squeeze in every possible romance trope that she could think of. And despite all of these great tropes–they might be cliches but they're so popular because they work–this book sucked. I'm sorry but I'm not sorry. Usually I save one star ratings for books that offend me with some form of racism or internalized misogyny or romanticizations of abusive relationships. This book teetered on the latter two issues but never fully delved into them, but I still couldn't bring myself to give this book two stars. 🌼 I couldn't stand the hero or the heroine. Naomi is a perfect goody-two shoes, so beautiful that every single guy has a hard-on for her, so nice that any person who talks to her instantly wants to be her friend. Her fatal flaw is that she cares too much and no one ever cares about her in return. Yawn. 🌼 Knox is The Worst. This book tries to be a grumpy x sunshine book, but Knox isn't just grumpy. He's an angry, controlling, manipulative hypocrite with daddy issues. He constantly pushes Naomi around, literally, even though it's supposed to be romantic because he's a big, sexy man? I can't believe the author had the audacity to write a hero so physically controlling for her heroine who just ran away from an abusive relationship. And when Knox broke things off with Naomi for literally no reason, he had the audacity to tell her, ""Can't we be fucking adults about this?"" Look in the goddamn mirror, Knox. 🌼 This book just didn't know what it wanted to be. There was the main romance plotline, full of all the tropes mentioned above, but there were so many subplots. Again, this book really didn't need to be 600 pages and it desperately needed an editor. 🌼 The characters were so one-dimensional and every issue/inconvenience felt extremely contrived. For instance, the ongoing subplot of Naomi trying to impress the CPS lady. In the end, it turned out to be a non-issue and only existed so the CPS lady could give Naomi advice about Knox. 🌼 This book descends into Life Lesson territory so fast. I don't read books to feel lectured, and I didn't need every single character to have a drawn-out heart-to-heart with each other to grasp the main meanings behind this book. I'm starting to think that subtlety in writing is a lost art. 🌼 I almost forgot that one of Knox's main character traits is that he won the lottery. And when it's first mentioned, they talk about how Knox was smart with his money and didn't blow it all on random things, so he's still a millionaire today. But throughout the entire book, Knox is so stupid with money. He quite literally throws his money at people to buy their affection. He likes to use his money to try and control people and resorts to bribery to get his way. And I'm supposed to believe this is a guy who is smart and benevolent with his money? Nope.🌼 Despite everything happening in this book, the characters were so flat that I couldn't find it in myself to ever care about them. The only two characters that intrigued me were Waylay and Evil Twin Sister. By the way, Evil Twin Sister is apparently a scourge on the earth because she couldn't handle having a perfect twin sister. She's the most black-and-white villain ever. I wanted more depth to her; I like having complicated villains. But nope, that would require a subtlety and nuance that this author apparently is allergic to. 🌼 I really didn't understand Knox's reasons for being so anti-relationship and I honestly didn't really care. The man is supposed to be in his mid-forties but he had the emotional maturity of a nineteen-year-old frat boy. Build a bridge and get over your issues because you're making yourself and everyone around you miserable."

Yes it kinda dragged. Maybe a lot. The characters didn’t really act their age. Despite the length of the book, not everything was tied well. The hero was kinda over the top jerk and the breakup didn’t make any sense and really frustrated me, Which brings us to the fact that I might’ve accepted those actions from a college boy not a grown 40 sth man. On the other hand; the heroine has the greatest best gay friend. I loved Stef so much. The kid was amazing. The super cool grandma and the cast of supporting characters. Last but not least Lucian and Sloane?? I got so freakin excited over their scenes and I freakin want more!!!!"

OMG I loved this damn book so much. This was my first Lucy Score book and I'm obsessed. I was totally hooked from the first few pages and I every time I had to sit the book down to do things like cook for my kids, take a shower or go to bed I thought about this book the whole time. I couldn't wait to get back to it and see what happened next. I was so engrossed in Naomi and Knox's life that I've been having a book hangover for the last two days. I haven't read any WOW books in a while( you know the books that are so good they stick with you forever) This book was definitely a WOW book for me. I loved every single thing about this book and I wouldn't change anything. 

Knox was so hot. I fell madly in love with the grumpy, tattooed, sexy, giving, and protective Knox. He could do no wrong in my book. Even when he was being a Jerk and there were a few times he was showing his ass I still understood him, empathized with him, and loved him. Naomi was just as amazing. No matter what life threw at her she just kept going. Making the best of her life. She was smart, sweet, strong, and she had such a big heart it was hard not to love her and hope she got everything she dreamed of. Waylay was so cute. I loved that little girl like she was a real person. I felt her pain, and her fear to love and trust. I loved how well she handled all the bad stuff in her young life and I loved her potty mouth lol. 

Knox and Naomi were so good together. I felt their love, their passion through the pages of this book. Their connection felt real. The book really took it's time deeply developing their relationship. The timing was perfect not too fast and not too slow. It was easy to see Knox and Naomi were made for each other. I loved them as a couple. Not only did I love the main couple I loved the secondary characters as well. They were all so well written and interesting that I couldn't help but love them too. Nash, Lucy, Sloane, Liza, Stef, Fi, and Lina were all great and I am hoping they all got their own books. Nash and Lina had some sparks. So did Lucy and Sloane. I loved that Lina (who was Knox's ex) wasn't catty or mean. She didn't try to come between Naomi and Knox she was just friendly to Naomi, and all around a cool person. The town was great and helpful. This book had it all. It was sweet, sexy, heart warming, and funny. I loved the ending and the bonus epilogue was so cute. Lucy Score now has a new fangirl and I have to go see what other books of hers I need to buy!

179,5,Things We Never Got Over,Lucy Score,179,2022-01-15,Isabella. R,4,"4 Tied Up In Fucking Knots Stars ⭐Things We Never Got Over was an entertaining hate to love saga. Considering this is a long ass book involving a mistaken identity, an irritated Viking and a whole lot of family drama, it kept me amused and engaged.“You’re telling me he’s a grumpy, overprotective hottie next-door and you’re not going to sleep with him? How wasteful.”People pleaser Naomi Witt is doing what she does best. Cleaning up another mess her deadbeat twin sister has left behind. But this time around the stakes a much higher. Becoming a guardian to a niece she never knew existed is just another upheaval to her already messy life.It's not his fault that Knox Morgan mistook Naomi for the town nuisance. Yet even once it's been cleared up, both Knox and Naomi can't stand each other on sight. So why can't he stop meddling with this woman who obviously wants nothing from him?“Who pissed in your Cheerios?” “Whoever taught you to express concern for a person did it wrong.”Part small town living, part attraction neither Knox or Naomi want to acknowledge, their lives are irrevocably involved. And once Knox removes his obnoxious head from his ass, even he has to admit that Naomi is everything he wasn't looking for but wants.The girl next door was about to crawl into my bed. I knew it was a mistake. But it was one I wanted to make.This book had so many great moments and headbutting scenes. All the contributing friends and family proves that in fact 'it does take a village to raise a child.' And what a motley crue these lot were! Although fun and emotional, it was just missing the spark I was hoping for."

I said it's because it's true.And also because alliteration.It's not an easy life, being built on the act of detesting. It angers my loved ones. It ruins my enjoyment of perfectly fine things, like citrus fruit or two and a half hour torture sessions superhero movies. But it does help me in one way, and that is in writing book reviews. Have you ever tried writing a five star review?? Yeesh. Awkward stuff. Very vulnerable and earnest. Not a fan.Complaining about a disappointing read, on the other hand...that's fun. That's the good life.Even when it's a universally beloved new release you really wanted to enjoy and instead just felt kind of meh about, like now. It's like a reward for a blah reading experience.So let's get into it.This is a romance novel, but I don't care for the romance very much. I have said many times that I'm not a romance reader who likes when the smut carries the love story. I'm here for the banter, luvs. Unfortch, both love interests in this repeatedly say their relationship is ""just sex,"" which means the romance only comes from smut.Also means that it seems to come out of nowhere that they suddenly Love Each Other, but whatevs!That's all okay anyway, because my secret is that I don't actually read romance for the romance - I read it for the sweet kind nice characters finding and liking THEMSELVES.But also that's not okay, because I don't care for those guys either.Our main character, Delilah, is a tattooed hottie who is cold and uncaring. This sounds good to me, as an aspiring tattooed hottie who is cold and uncaring. However, Delilah's internal monologue involves a lot of ""everyone is mean to me!!!"" when she is, in fact, a b*tch to everyone, so that's kind of a lose/lose.If you're going to be rude constantly, be unapologetic. That's what I do.In this book, Delilah is going to her estranged stepsister Astrid's wedding to be the photographer in exchange for a lot of money and a bad time. Astrid thinks that Delilah is a b*tch and she has a troubled life, when in fact she herself is quite spoiled and Delilah has spent her life alone.Astrid has two friends, Claire and Iris. Iris thinks Delilah is weird and has since childhood, when in fact Iris is a bully and it's weird we are supposed to like her, when she tortured Delilah as an adolescent and still talks to her in the exact same way and generally does not appear to have changed very much.Claire, the other friend, is also the love interest, and she pulls double duty both on that and on thinking Delilah is mistreating her while she is actively hiding their relationship, continually asking Delilah to keep it secret, and generally acting like being with Delilah is something shameful. Sheesh! What a barrel of monkeys these people are. (I don't think that's an expression in this context but I do think it is cute.)Unrelated, but also Delilah and Claire have sex for the first time while using a Literary Witches Oracle tarot deck, which once upon a time an ex boyfriend gave me, so that was a weird and unpleasant commonality for the three of us to have.Honestly I'm sorry I even brought it up.Bottom line: You may be tempted to cancel me for this take, but just remember - YOU LIKE ME FOR MY UNPOPULAR OPINIONS!---------------pre-reviewi know i've said many times that i love literary fiction about unlikable characters.i want it on the record that that does not apply to romance.review to come / 2.5 stars---------------tbr reviewdelilah green and i have so much in common(ty netgalley for the e-arc)"

Delilah Green Doesn't Care is about Delilah and Claire. Delilah is a lonely artist in the big city who must go back home to her small town to be a wedding photographer for her estranged step sister, Astrid. In returning home she confronts difficult childhood memories, a complicated family dynamic and a stubborn childhood crush that still has a hold on her. Claire is a mother to an adorable tween named Ruby who she's struggling to do right by while in a messy co-parenting situation with Ruby's father, Josh. When these two women reunite sparks fly.Y'all this was brilliant. The story was so fun, and sexy and full of romcom absurdity but it was also a really kind and heartfelt narrative full of nuanced characters and I loved it so much. I adored Claire and Delilah's connection, there was such passion and intensity between them but there was also so much tenderness and I loved how vulnerable they were with one another. I love the way this story handles Claire's parenting woes, as she became a mother at a very young age and she's constantly worried about whether she's doing what's best for Ruby and being the best parent she could be. It was just really great and I liked seeing how her parenting anxieties were handled. As for Delilah, I loved seeing how her lonely childhood led to an isolated adult life and how she struggled to break those cycles, her childhood traumas were just handled so deftly. Loved how the relationship between Astrid and Delilah was explored. The story also has a really good cast of cool side characters and I can't wait to learn more about them in subsequent books in the series. Overall this was great, delightfully queer, surprisingly sexy, and so heartfelt.4.5 stars"
182,6,Delilah Green Doesn't Care,Ashley Herring Blake,182,2021-12-18,Alexis Hall,None,"Source of book: NetGalley (thank you!)Relevant disclaimers: NonePlease note: This review may not be reproduced or quoted, in whole or in part, without explicit consent from the author.Oh. My. God. This book is EVERYTHING. It made me feel so happy and seen and spoken to as a queer person that I literally hugged my kindle to my chest on several occasions while I was reading it.So this is pretty complex stuff, okay? I know I’ve discussed the queerness of queer romance in various other reviews and let me just make very clear yet again that I am not trying to position myself as any sort of gatekeeper of queerness. Queer is not a monolith, we all see ourselves reflected in different ways and in different things, and that’s how it should be. But I will say that I have a sense that queer romance is in a complicated place publishing-wise (EDIT: in terms of queer romance published by mainstream publishers) at the moment: it’s been comprehensively proven there’s a market for it, but I think there’s a natural conflict at the heart of this market concerning the needs of queer readers versus the expectations of the dominant cishet audience. All of which is to say that I personally (and I am speaking purely personally here) can often find reading queer romance quite an alienating experience. This has nothing to do, I hasten to add, with the identity (or even the skill) of the author. It’s purely about my perception of who the book is speaking to.And I think part of what’s extraordinary about Delilah Green Doesn’t Care is that the book delivers everything you’d want in a romance (it’s sexy, it’s funny, it’s heart-wrenching, it’s tender) alongside a sensibility that feels, to me, effortlessly and unabashedly queer. For example, there’s the fact one of the protagonists—Claire—is bisexual, and it feels genuinely like part of her identity, rather than a word on the page, shaping how she understands herself and relates to the world around her. Or there’s a throwaway line that I personally found so well-observed, which is when Delilah (who is not attracted to men) is at a bar, and the (male) bartender keeps hitting on her, and she’s irate that she’s probably going to have to come out to this random stranger to make him leave her alone - that sense of coming out as a permanent state imposed upon you resonated with me so hard. And, now I come to think of it, there’s the fact an entire subplot concerns Astrid (Delilah’s sister and Claire’s best friend) and her impending marriage to a dreadful cishet guy. That just feels like … the queerest thing in the world to me. That half-bewildered, half-alienated sense of watching your heterosexual friends make terrible romantic decisions with other heterosexuals, wondering to yourself are the straights all right, and is there anything you can do about it. The book is full of little moments like this, from the profound to the trivial, that make the fictional world the characters inhabit feel familiar and real and—to me, at least—recognisably and undeniably queer. Anyway. The actual plot here concerns Delilah Green, a thirty-ish photographer, currently trying to make it in NYC having fled the small town where she grew up. Tragically orphaned at a young age, she was cast upon the care of her emotionally distant stepmother and her apparently perfect daughter, both of whom made no attempt to make the grieving Delilah feel welcome in their family. The perfect daughter, Astrid, is now getting married and Delilah has been summoned back to Bright Falls to be the wedding photographer. While Delilah has come along way from the lonely, insecure girl she once was, returning to the place where she grew up can’t help but stir up old memories and old hurts, particularly when it comes to Astrid and her close-knit friendship group who always contributed to Delilah’s sense of rejection. There’s a lot going on in Delilah Green Doesn’t Care, including some Bridesmaids-style hijinks involving champagne glass towers, but I think what struck me most forcibly about its storytelling is its generosity. It’s very kind to its characters, allowing them plenty of scope to be as complicated and as damaged as they need to be, while simultaneously letting them shine in their relationships with each other, their deep needs to love and be loved. Hell, even Iris who is like Friend Trope #2673 (loud and red-headed) has her own shit going on that gives her depth and nuance beyond the usual “saying the thing” role such characters tend to be relegated to. Ruby, Claire’s pre-teen daughter, is exactly as endearing and frustrating as you’d expect from a girl of that particular age. And Claire’s irresponsible but well-meaning ex-husband gets his own little maturation arc that feels genuinely earned. Yes, there are a couple of villain figures in the narrative who come across as slightly cartoonish in their awfulness, especially compared to the rest of the cast, but by the end of the book their general irrelevance has become its own significance. Because ultimately this is a story that is far more interested in how we show love to each other, than taking revenge on those who have hurt us, and I absolutely adore it for that. It is a gorgeous sapphic romance, a celebration of found family and a beautiful exploration of the way home and freedom, in the right context, with the right person, can feel like exactly the same thing.A thousand heart-hands for this book. You all need to read it."
183,6,Delilah Green Doesn't Care,Ashley Herring Blake,183,2022-11-21,Chelsea (chelseadolling reads),5,"Prior to picking this one up I had read two of Ashley Herring Blake's middle grade books and one of her YA's and given them all 5 star ratings and I am SO HAPPY to report that miss Delilah Green carries on the 5 star streak!! This book was everything my queer, romance loving heart needed and I am so!!!!! glad!!!!! that it exists. From every single character having their own distinct lives and personalities to the ~RELATIONSHIPS~ between them, this book was perfect. Delilah and Claire and Astrid and Ruby and IRIS!!!! MY HEART! This review is rambling and makes absolutely no sense but please just take my word for it that this was an absolute delight and you neeeeeed! to pick it up when it comes out in February. Also I am *desperate* to read book two because from the snippet I read it looks like that one is also going to be queer?????? WOW I JUST HAVE THE MIGHTIEST NEED PLS READ THIS BOOK SO WE CAN HAVE A MILLION MORE LIKE IT THANK YOU YOU WON'T REGRET IT XOXOCW: death of a parent"
184,6,Delilah Green Doesn't Care,Ashley Herring Blake,184,2022-02-23,Lex Kent,5,"My first full 5 Star book of 2022! I loved this. This is exactly the type of romance I want to read and I could not be happier. While I have never read Blake before, I have a few of her YA books sitting on my Kindle waiting to be read, so when I saw she wrote a sapphic adult romance, I just knew I had to read it. I was also happy to see that Berkley keeps putting out new sapphic books and I hope they continue since they have all been enjoyable. Anyway, this is a book I would absolutely recommend to any romance fans and I’m hopeful that people will enjoy it as much as I did.First, I want to mention again that this is an adult romance. I noticed quite a few people marked this YA, probably because of what Blake normally writes, but this is definitely not YA and people should know that going into it. I’ve been having better luck with YA lately so this was a real treat for me to read such a great adult romance. I was trying to figure out what tropes this book fit but it was a little tough to do. It is kind of a second change romance, but not really. The second chances are really more about different friendships. I then was thinking maybe enemies to lovers, but that doesn’t really work either -more like indifferent to lovers maybe-. This book doesn’t quite fit into any one box but that might be one of the reasons it was so good.The characters in this book are really well done. It is not just the two mains but also a group of friends that the book centers on like Astrid, the ice queen -who you want to know more about-, and Iris, the comedic relief. I did find the sort of villain characters to have been a tad cartoonish at times, but one added to some good emotional moments where the other added to some enjoyable humor. In the end, the fact they were a bit over-the-top actually worked. There was even a well written kid character and a well done ex character which both can be pretty rare in sapphic books. Everyone was just on pointe and you feel completely transported into this small town among this interesting group of characters. While I really loved every part of this book, the romance really shines. I loved the two mains together. They had this great mix of sweetness and heat that was exactly what you want to see in a good romance. The chemistry was perfect and it just got stronger as the book went on. I won’t go into details, for spoiler reasons, but I have to say that I just LOVED the meet-cute. It would easily make my list of top favorite meet-cutes ever. I found that it actually gave me butterflies in my stomach and it’s been a long time since a book did that. It was great, just like the whole book.TLDR: This was a real joy to read and it was my favorite book of 2022 so far. It was not perfect, there were a few tiny bumps, but there was so much good here that anything little that might have been an issue, ended up not mattering one bit. I loved the humor, all the emotions, the friendships, and the really good chemistry and heat. It was such a well-rounded book and I want to read more. I’m happy to say that yes, there is more coming and that there will be a second book starting the ice queen character. I honestly can’t wait. This is an easy book to recommend and I'm excited to see everyone else fall in love with it too.An ARC was given to me for a review."

“Okay, I’ll give you that Wuthering Heights is the least romantic book in the history of Victorian romances, but Jane Eyre?”“Is that the one where the douchebag hid his wife away in the attic and then lied about it to the girl he wanted to bang who was, like, half his age?”Claire winced. “Well, when you put it like that.”
*sobs in bi*this is beautiful.and you know who else is beautiful? this babe I happily buddy-(re)read this with.i loved this book even more, this time around; i guess any book is nice if you read it with someone you deeply care about, but delilah green doesn't care is objectively a cute, entertaining and impossibly steamy novel that my heart can't help but recognise as one of my absolute favorites of the genre. claire and delilah are amazing characters, together and individually, but i also really loved iris and astrid (or ass-trid like leni and i love to call her), and i appreciated the sisterhood-friendship part of the novel. delilah isn't an easy character to like, especially at the beginning, but i guess she had some leftover trauma and harsh feelings to process before she could become the character the author intended her to be at the end of the story. claire, too, had her little flaws, but i saw a lot of myself in her, especially on things concerning her bisexuality and motherhood. i'm not gonna over-analyze the whole thing or its writing, because it was alright and i don't have anything to say about it except that it was super enjoyable and so steamy i almost chocked on my pizza reading one of the smutty scenes. oh, and i can't believe i only just found out this was ashley herring blake's debut??? i thought i'd have to catch up with all her past novels, turns out i'll have to keep an eye out for her furure ones :D"

187,6,Delilah Green Doesn't Care,Ashley Herring Blake,187,2022-03-29,Gabby,3,"This book was fine, and I’m sad because I wanted to be more obsessed with this than I am. This had all the ingredients to be a favorite for me, Delilah is a photographer with tattoos who has a complicated relationship with her sister, and Claire is a single mom who owns a book store… this should’ve been everything!! The premise is amazing. But there was just something missing for me? I didn’t feel a spark between these two? I don’t know if it’s because I listened to it on audio, but the sex scenes were pretty awkward and I just wasn’t feeling it at times. Also, a small nitpicky thing that doesn’t really matter, but why do the chapters have to be soooo long? It’s a small pet peeve of mine but it drives me crazy haha I was just hoping to love this more than I did 😭"

189,6,Delilah Green Doesn't Care,Ashley Herring Blake,189,2022-04-30,theresa,4,"adult sapphic romance vlog coming to my channel soon!Deliah Green Doesn’t Care is a fun, swoony romance novel. I have been highly anticipating this book ever since the cover was announced because, honestly, who could resist such a pretty cover? Not to mention the characters are hot. So I’m happy to say that although Delilah Green was not the new favourite I hoped for, it still definitely lived up to the hype.This book is told from a dual point of view and I really enjoyed reading from both Delilah and Claire. They each had a unique voice and distinct personalities. Delilah was equal parts snarky and charismatic and vulnerable. Claire was kind and caring – the ultimate mum friend. They saw the world and the people around them differently based on their life and previous experiences with them which was really interesting. This was particularly clear when it came to Astrid, Delilah’s step sister. Claire saw through Astrid’s hard exterior to her best friend from childhood while Delilah, who never got to know her step sister that well and had some bad experiences with her as a child, only saw that hard exterior. It meant that both narrators would experience a scene entirely differently so it was really fun switching between POV’s.I also loved Delilah and Claire together. From the initial tension and flirtation to realising they actually wanted each other was a delight to read. Both our main characters yearned for love and connection in different ways and I loved seeing them find that in each other. The sex scenes were well written and enjoyable, and the way the two characters described each other and thought about each other was so good. They’re both so hot I would like to date them both. I also adored the scenes between Delilah and Claire’s daughter. This is what I’d been looking forward to most about the book as I am a sucker for romances where one of the characters has a kid and we follow the other partner meeting the kid and falling a little in love with them too. Delilah Green definitely lived up to my expectations there.I really enjoyed the main plotline of trying to call off the wedding and get Astrid to dump her fiancé. It really made the friendship between Claire, Iris and Astrid shine and I loved seeing Delilah find her place in that dynamic. It was also a great vehicle to develop Astrid and Delilah’s relationship and I loved this exploration of the complications of grief and misunderstandings and family. This was truly the heart of the novel and it was so well written. I can't wait to continue this journey in Astrid Parker Doesn't Fail!Overall, Delilah Green Doesn’t Care is a wonderful romance novel guaranteed to make you swoon, even as the emotional beats make your heart twinge. It is a book about healing and growing and love in all its forms and I so highly recommend it.I also talk about books here: youtube | instagram | twitter *eARC received in exchange for an honest review via Netgalley*"
190,6,Delilah Green Doesn't Care,Ashley Herring Blake,190,2022-11-26,gloria .☆ﾟ.  ,5,"➥ 4.5 Stars *:･ﾟ✧""I...well...I want to see you again.""""You want to fuck me again, you mean,"" Delilah said, but she was smiling. This she knew. This she understood. She'd had lovers she'd seen for multiple days, even weeks, before one of them broke it off for some amiable and practical reason.Pink spilled into Claire's cheeks. ""Okay, fine. Yes. Don't you?""""Want to fuck me?""""Delilah.""She laughed, then moved their entwined hands around Claire's waist, pulling the other woman closer. When their mouths touched, she whispered, ""Yes. I want to fuck you again.""━━━━━━━━━━━ ♡ ━━━━━━━━━━━Amy and I having an enjoyable, fabulous buddy read? Unheard of, but today's the day it seems. I fucking love this book in case all of you couldn't tell. But please, allow me to explain in detail.This book follows Delilah and Claire, two characters who had always distanced themselves from eachother in their childhood, bonding while attending Delilah's step-sister, Astrid's wedding. Who also happens to be Claire's best friend. We have tropes like single parent, forced proximity, and friends with benefits. And, wow, the execution was amazing.➥ Delilah (h)...whew I liked her for sure. Such a great fmc. She's so hot oh my DEAR, it's not okay!!! And she was pretty funny too. I appreciated how fleshed out her character was, rather than just eyes for the reader to see out of - the way fmcs tend to be. She was left out of many friend groups when she was younger, so she packed and moved out as soon as she could, following her passion for photography. And I love her name, it's so pretty. I loved when Claire said it, just one word. ➥ Claire (h) was also pretty great. She was so sweet and caring, and she's been through so much :( She's a single mother, a very admirable one. I really enjoyed her character but I don't have much else to say.➥ Ruby (Claire's daughter) was such a great character. Why, you ask? Because she was written so realistically. So many single parent romances write the children like little angels, balls of sunshine that are just the absolute cutest. And yes, they are cute and I do kind of love them. But they're beyond unrealistic. Children are rarely so simple and easy and smiley. We see Claire struggling with being the mean parent while Josh (I wish I could cut off his balls fr) gets to be the fun parent that hops into her life when she feels like it. I felt Claire's pain, seeing her daughter favour the other parent so much more. It also showed how difficult children are at times, their tantrums, their stubbornness etc. Having seen what it's like to be a parent first hand, I appreciate how the author executed this aspect so realistically. Ruby herself wasn't my favourite character ever, but that then just supports my decision to not want to pop some lmaoo.➥ Iris (Astrid's bff) was so funny oh my god. I cannot wait for her book, you don't understand. She's such an awesome, fun, loveable character.➥ Astrid (Delilah's sister) was a tough one. I felt for her by the end but it was so tough to like her at the beginning. I'm looking forward to her having her gay awakening though lmao, that's going to be fun.First of all, can I just say that it makes me so happy to see sapphics finally getting some good, new adult romcoms. I don't know how to really articulate this but I feel like we're finally getting the type's of books that straight people get and it makes me so hopeful. Also, mad respect for this author for getting traditionally published. I'm aware that it's really rare for publishing companies to publish ff romances; a huge problem in the publishing industry. But look at this now. With over 15, 000 ratings. That's such an achievement and I'm so so glad that people are reading more ff.I loved the small-town vibes, the way there was no homophobia, and so many other things. Although Amy and Elena had told me they struggled to get into this book, I found the beginning decently gripping and I was pretty quickly enthralled in this magnificent book. The romance is to die for. I feel like I cannot even describe it properly. The chemistry was amazing, the sexual tension - impeccable, and just overall beyond swoony. I'm so serious, I was giggling and smiling all throughout (except for when I was crying at the end but I digress).
Delilah closed her umbrella and set it outside on the stoop and stepped inside. She pushed Claire's front door closed before crowding into her space, hands on Claire's hips and her mouth bumping up against Claire's bottom lip as she spoke.""I missed you,"" she said.Claire couldn't breathe. Didn't dare. ""You did?""Delilah nodded and she kissed her - once, twice, soft and sweet that in no way indicated that she was expecting to fall into bed immediately. In fact, this kiss, well, it felt like Delilah expected...something more.
I'm going to be honest, I was so obsessed with this book that I kind of forgot to take notes so this is a little messy, but just know that this book made me laugh and cry but most of all - smile. I just loved it so so much. Oh, and it's so fun once you finally get the meaning of the title.
""He's my co-parent,"" Claire said. ""He's not... We're not like that.""""But you have been? I mean, since you've broken up?""Claire blinked but wanted to be honest. ""Yeah. But not for a while. Over two years ago.""""But it's still complicated.""""Why do you care?""The question slipped out, spoken sharply and softly at the same time. Delilah watched her for a second and then slid around the island's corner, closer and closer. Claire's body shifted with her until they were standing right in front of each other, her lower back pressed against the quartz.Delilah stepped into her space, arms on either side of Claire's hips, braced against the counter and hemming her in. Instinctively, Claire's hands went to Delilah's waist, fingers curling through the cotton of her shirt. She tugged a little, pulling Delilah that much closer. Their hips aligned, breasts, not an inch of space between their bodies.Delilah leaned in, her bottom lip barely whispering against Claire's.""I don't care,"" she said.And that was all it took for Claire to side a hand into Delilah's hair and close the last bit of distance between them.
What else is there left to say, really? The sex was hot, the romance was quality. That's about it. I'm so sad I read the ebook version rather than buying it in paperback. I might just buy it physically for a reread. The only few criticisms I have are that 1: I don't think Josh should have had this whole redemption thing he had. I wanted him out of their lives. 2: The wedding drama was a little too prominent. I didn't mind it too much but I would have preferred a little less of that and more delilahclaire. 3: Where the fuck is the epilogue, I need one. Preferably with a sex scene in it. Anyway, I can't wait for the next book omg. This author has the potential to be a new favourite of mine.━━━━━━━━━━━ ♡ ━━━━━━━━━━━"
191,6,Delilah Green Doesn't Care,Ashley Herring Blake,191,2022-06-19,Kezia Duah,3,"Delilah’s character is a really cool one. She has goals she is working towards and generally seems to not care what others think of her. Her step-sister, Astrid, is getting married and is looking to use Delilah’s photography talents for the occasion. Deliah really does not want to go back to that town, but also, it’s a lot of money! She does and she sees Claire, who is part of Astrid’s coven. Delilah’s words, not mine. They are attracted to each other and that also becomes a major part of this book. The part where we explore Delilah’s childhood, including her relationship with her family, was what I was genuinely interested in. I also enjoyed exploring how it has affected her and her many relationships today. Astrid’s storyline was also interesting. Pleasing parents syndrome is a struggle we often see in many books, but Astrid’s struggle in this one felt a bit more unique than others I’ve read. I don’t really care for other stuff in the book, with some being predictable. Overall, an enjoyable read that gave a little “average” vibes. "
192,6,Delilah Green Doesn't Care,Ashley Herring Blake,192,2022-03-14,K.J. Charles,None,"Tremendous romance. Wonderfully real characters--this is a book that isn't afraid to have its characters be messy, sometimes self-centred, with real and thus often difficult, misplaced, and highly unflattering emotions. (They also drink an incredible amount *without the story once punishing them for it* which is sufficiently rare in US romance as to be noticeable.) Super queer, with glorious female friendships as well as the central romance. And really well written, too. A fabulous and hugely enjoyable story of people finding their place and each other. Enormously recommended. "

194,6,Delilah Green Doesn't Care,Ashley Herring Blake,194,2022-09-27,Bookishrealm,5,"I always get so nervous about books that get a lot of buzz because I'm afraid that I won't feel the same way as other readers, but this one did not disappoint. I can't wait to read more from Ashley Herring Blake.Delilah Green Doesn't Care is the first in a new series that centers the relationship between tattooed photographer Delilah and her step-sisters best friend Claire. Delilah vowed never to return to Bright Falls after leaving, but makes the decision to come back when her estranged step sister Astrid decides to hire her for a wedding. Of course, things get a little more complicated with Delilah meets Claire again for the first time in years. What starts off as a ploy to break up Astrid and her atrocious fiancé becomes a much deeper exploration of love, self-worth, and family. One of the most enjoyable things that I found about this book was the complexity of the plot. And I don't mean complex in a way that means it was difficult to follow, but it contained so much depth. Not only are readers getting the opportunity to see the development of the relationship between Delilah and Claire, but there is also plot development that occurs in relationship to characters and their family members as well as internal development. For Delilah, there is internal conflict related to how she perceives herself due to the ill treatment of her step mother. Then there is external conflict with her step-sister Astrid that has to be worked through. Claire struggles greatly with the relationship she has with the father of child. While it may seem like this is too much conflict, it created dynamic and well developed main characters and side characters. It felt realistic. In no way shape or form do any of us enter in a relationship without internal and external conflicts so it was nice to see Delilah and Claire not only have to work through their feelings about each other, but also the ways in which they saw themselves and others around them. And let's talk about Blake's writing style. It was so fluid and entertaining. The way she seamlessly wove in a dual narrative with complex side characters is brilliant. Everyone had distinct personalities and characteristics which can be hard to capture. Her writing was layered lending to a complex plot that was unexpected. I was extremely invested in this story and the characters which usually isn't a thing for me when it comes to traditionally published romances. Honestly, if everything by Blake is like this (I mean in terms of writing style, plot development, and character development) then I can't wait to pick up more of her works. And the steamy scenes!!!! Whoooo, I was fanning myself at one point. Blake does a great job illustrating both the physical and emotional attraction that Delilah and Claire have to each other. Honestly, if you haven't given this one a try and you enjoy small town romances and/or sapphic romances then you definitely need to give this a try. I promise it won't disappoint."

197,6,Delilah Green Doesn't Care,Ashley Herring Blake,197,2022-09-28,destiny ♡ howling libraries,3,"Having sung the praises of AHB's MG and YA titles for so many years now, nobody is more disappointed than me to say that this book was a struggle. I actually set it aside 50pg in the first time I tried reading it, and had to pick it back up with an audiobook to force myself past the first few chapters because I disliked Delilah's character so much. Thankfully, the audiobook narrator was fantastic and I gradually was drawn in enough to give the story a solid chance.In the end, Delilah slowly redeemed herself a little bit for me, but it took a very long time to get there and I still wasn't a huge fan by the time I reached the last page. I typically LOVE prickly, unlikable protagonists, but Delilah's particular flavor of attitude was so petty and self-centered that I had a hard time working past it. I will admit that I felt a lot of empathy for her unresolved traumas and I loved watching her bond with Ruby and play pranks on Astrid's disgusting groom-to-be, but I spent most of the book wishing I could tell her to grow up.All of that said, I thought Delilah and Claire had a lot of chemistry, and I actually loved Astrid's character from the start, so I'm very eager to read the next book and see her get the love she deserves. AHB's narrative voice is engaging and fun, and I can see why so many people loved this book. I'm sad that I wasn't one of them, but I have high hopes for the sequel!I read a final copy I purchased myself, but for the sake of disclosure, I was also sent an early review copy by the author/publisher. All thoughts are honest and my own.✨ Representation: several sapphic (lesbian and bi) characters, one very minor side character uses they/them pronouns✨ Content warnings for: mentions of breakups and infidelity, memories of parent loss and grief, bullying, misogyny, absent parents ———twitter | booktok | bookstagram | blog"
198,6,Delilah Green Doesn't Care,Ashley Herring Blake,198,2022-05-25,Katie Colson,3,"3.5⭐👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻All the applause for Ashley Herring Blake for understanding the difference between Young Adult and Adult 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻I've read her YA and enjoyed them, but was skeptical about her branching into adult. She understood the assignment! It was ADULT. Yes, they were stunted youths. But it was adults acting YA or YA acting like adults. It was full grown adults who needed to work through their shit. And I love AHB for doing it.She had full sapphic sex scenes. She was serving f/f romance. AHB came to PLAY y'all.Now, I will say I have a bias because Lilah is my favorite name and Green is my favorite color. Also, I heavily identified with Delilah when she was goth in high school but grew up to have black hair and wear black skinny jeans. I mean, HELLO, ✨me✨.BUT. being a reader who doesn't lean toward cutesy romance, this didn't press my buttons.And let me tell you that I did not like the ending AT ALL. A T A L L. I get it's realistic. But that's not what I come into a romance for. "
199,6,Delilah Green Doesn't Care,Ashley Herring Blake,199,2022-08-14,Whitney Atkinson,2,"i almost DNFed this at page 250 but decided to stick it through, and i'm really sad this didn't live up to the hype for me. i think the storyline could've been great (other than the fact that characters with kids is a really big turn off for me), but the writing absolutely decimated my enjoyment of this. having read middle grade books by this author, it gave off the same energy where she was over-explaining everything to the reader. other than making the book pointlessly long and overwritten, it also felt really condescending and corny. there were other little things that i didn't like, like all the character banter and comebacks felt really contrived and i hated that the friend group called each other ""sweetie"" and ""honey"" CONSTANTLY. just so many little icks that added up over time that i almost couldn't do it. i'm disappointed because i really really loved how to make a wish but this one was a total let down. i hope i'm not alone because it kinda feels homophobic to not love this as much as everyone else does lol"
200,6,Delilah Green Doesn't Care,Ashley Herring Blake,200,2022-05-22,Jess Owens,4,"I really enjoyed this but I did have some issues. I’d give it a 3.75/5 if we’re getting technical. CW: mentions of cancer, loss of parents. Delilah lives in NYC and is a struggling artist. Her family is back in Oregon but she doesn’t go often because she doesn’t have a great relationship with them. But her step sister, Astrid, is getting married and hired Delilah as the photographer, so she’s going back home for 2 weeks. My biggest issues were the author was trying to make it a point that she is an intersectional feminist, which is great, but my god, can you be anymore blatant ? Every time a person was described it was she was a white woman. He was a cishet white man, she’s a white woman. It doesn’t sound bad but it happened so often if felt clunky. Another thing was I thought the subplots were almost more of the focus than the main romance. Delilah has family issues. Claire has baby daddy issues. And they both take up a lot of the story. Claire’s issues were more interesting to me than Delilah’s, I just didn’t really care about the sister/ step sister drama. One of the friends is named Iris and this is so dumb but they shorten her name to Ris and that bothered me. Her name is only TWO syllables and got shorten it?? Hate hate hate. And Iris was annoying overall. I did like Delilah overall; even tho sometimes I was like GROW UP. Both Delilah and Claire are hotties from their description, both my type LOL. I thought they had good chemistry but Claire’s issues with her baby daddy sometimes made me feel she still had real feelings for him too?Oh and the sexy times were giving chiiiiile 😏Overall really enjoyed and would read more from this author. I’ve seen the titles for future books and I don’t know if I’d care to read Iris’ story but we’ll see …"
201,6,Delilah Green Doesn't Care,Ashley Herring Blake,201,2022-07-12,Maria,5,"4.5 Rounding up, because I appreciate when authors have basic wine knowledge and because I cried a little. I liked this book a lot. The main characrers were well written and while I didn't agree with all their choices, I could understand them. I also thought the different perspectives on Delilah and Astrid's childhood trauma was pretty compelling.I've seen readers calling out how immature some of the groups' actions were, which I get. I just think sometimes we regress when we hang out with with people we grew up with. Like I don't recite the lines of Dirty Dancing with any of the friends I've made in the last 10 years, but please believe my OG friends are regularly advised that ""God wouldn’t have given you maracas if he didn’t want you to shake ’em!"""

203,6,Delilah Green Doesn't Care,Ashley Herring Blake,203,2022-03-10,Natalie,2,"Delilah Green Doesn’t Care and frankly…..neither do I. This was a total slog to get through for me and it’s quite honestly a miracle I didn’t DNF this even 15% in. What I expected was a funny, charming, badass queer MC that executes the relationship bet trope well, with maybe some sharp insights on family and grief. What I got was an MC who is so caught up being incredibly petty and bitter, she tries to ruin her step sister’s wedding events at every turn, she tries to use and discard someone who she knows has suffered heartbreak and has a complicated life with a pre-teen as a single mom, she doesn’t take any accountability for her actions, AND she doesn’t exhibit any self awareness or reflection of how the grief of her losses may have affected how she interacts and treats others until the very very end - and even then, it’s cursory at best. Delilah is quite frankly - the worst. Honestly at reading that she was happy when Claire gets pregnant in high school because it means she won’t go to college with Astrid and Iris (the Covenant) I wanted to end the journey there - and I should have. How is this cool? How is this badass? How is this ok? While you can argue the petty thought is normal for a young 18/19 year old, Delilah sticks by this feeling as a grown adult of 29. It’s icky. And we see later on through Delilah that really, Claire never even bullied her, never did anything to her, so you can’t even think it’s ok because Claire was so awful to her. A lot of the family and “bullying” excuses used to justify and excuse Delilah’s behavior were pretty thin - she’s called a ghoul monster ONCE. She sees the pressure Isabel puts on Astrid and ignores it. She shuts Astrid out just as much as Astrid did her. But of course, Delilah’s petty behavior has to be justified, she needs to be validated for trying to ruin a wedding, spill and break champagne towers at events, purposely stress and rile Astrid up when she’s already clearly unhappy, la la la la. All of the other characters are one-dimensional and unlikeable, I think Iris is meant to be that sharp, raw honest friend and character that you somehow love for telling it like it is, but she was grating and not at all clever. Her dead pan jokes didn’t land and she didn’t feel purposeful or needed as a character. All bark, no bite, as she doesn’t even confront Astrid about her douche fiancé. Pass. Claire was meant to be the likable character I think, but she also needed to get her shit together. Her weird sexual relationship with her baby daddy didn’t make sense as apparently “no casual sex” is a major character cornerstone for her - so why is she sleeping with him when she knows they don’t love each other anymore and they never pursue a rekindling of their romantic relationship anyway? Her dynamic with him felt too high school, which makes it worse knowing they have a pre-teen daughter they’re raising together and are adults now - they’re 30! I also felt the baby daddy (already forgot his name) got way too much of a pass considering he constantly skipped town and abandoned his child. It felt like the author tried to soften and excuse that with a fairytale ending with lots of pretty words and promises on his end - but I was over it. Clearly this lacks insight to see how damaging that actually is to their child and Claire and was instead used as a convenient tension plot point. The sister’s confrontation and reconciliation moments with Delilah and Astrid lacked emotional punch and true, deep self-reflection. It’s all done in a matter of paragraphs without really diving into each of their own perspectives on their grief. Both of them lost their dads. Both grew up in some sense of isolation and with a mother/step mother that is frankly an insane stepford wife wannabe. That’s A LOT of trauma and emotion, none of which is explored with any sense of meaning and purpose. We never see Delilah really take accountability for her behavior much, and I don’t mean as kids, but rather as adults, at what she did during all of Astrid’s wedding events. I could keep going with all the issues I had, but I think my point has been made - this felt very mediocre to me, the characters read as way too immature and bratty for their ages, and it felt like there was no, or definitely not enough emotional or character depth. I’ll be skipping the rest of this series, which is a shame since I was hoping this would be a winner. "

206,6,Delilah Green Doesn't Care,Ashley Herring Blake,206,2022-11-04,paige,5,"""I got it to remind myself to have some perspective. That, most times, things aren't as devastating as they might feel at first.""°•*⁀➷I think that finding a quote that speaks to you is such a special feeling, but finding the exact quote that comes to mean so much for the entirety of the book you're reading... that only makes it more so. Delilah has a tattoo to remind her to have some perspective, and then promptly forgets to have perspective for the rest of the book. Just like all of our favorite heroines do. It absolutely makes for a special story.I don't know what I was expecting going into this book. It was recommended by a friend whom I love, and I can never say no to the people I love. I never would have picked it up on my own. I never would have read the blurb on the back. I never would have known Delilah Green. That would have been a travesty.The lesson I learned for that, always listen to your friends.My favorite love stories are the ones that follow more than just a romantic love. ESPECIALLY when that love is one of friendship. The dynamic of realizing that the ""mean girls"" are only mean girls because of perspective (see above quote), and watching Delilah realize that. Watching her fall for them, and subtly become a part of their group? It meant so much to me as someone who has always tried to see the best in people. No matter how they acted. That captivated me from the start. The beautiful life long friendship built between Astrid, Claire, and Iris.What sunk me was Delilah herself. Her story. Her journey. She's lonely, and sad, just as every artist is. She makes beauty out of that feeling and captures it all around her with her camera. I love that most of the reason Astrid realizes how unhappy she is comes from one of Delilah's pictures of captures sadness. It's so beautiful to me that in the end, despite all of their feelings towards each other, Delilah truly saves her sister from a sad, broken life. There has to be irony in that.I was lost in the art of it all. The photography. My life has taken a much different path than I thought it would, but sometimes I forget that I studied photography for all the same reasons Delilah made it her life's work. I don't have her talent, or her drive, and I don't find validation in all of it like she does... but I felt all the same things she did when she explained how she felt. I could see her pictures. I fell in love with her as Claire did.Read this to learn all the same things Delilah did so truthfully: to have perspective when you don't understand something. It might hurt to be vulnerable, to put yourself on the line for someone else, but it's always worth it in the end.- Paige"

“she belonged somewhere, despite years of emotional displacement. she’d found something. she’d been found by someone.”
delilah green doesn’t care follows the titular delilah, a photographer who left bright falls years ago after an isolating childhood. now, she’s (very reluctantly) back in town for her stepsister astrid’s wedding. her plans to keep everyone at arm’s length goes awry when she meets claire, astrid’s best friend and can’t help but push her buttons.where’s /my/ heavily tattooed girlfriend this life is a scam i would like a refund !!on a more serious note, delilah green doesn’t care is. so many things at once.it is inherently, unabashedly, and undeniably queer; so tenderly woven into each character’s identity and how they interact with the world. and that honesty just. makes these characters feel as comforting as home. when delilah wonders “are the straights okay”, you Get It.it’s about being lost and found. how the home that you were so desperate to leave, could end up being the place where you find yourself, and where others find you. its the realization that you’re tougher than you think, and what was once seemingly unmanageable to you, could very well be the place where you put down your roots.because it’s also about growth and reconnection - giving yourself the space you need to be complicated and messy and treating all of that with kindness. to let yourself heal from all that childhood trauma and acknowledge the need to love and be loved. its the struggle to trust others because that leaves your heart wide open and how that shuts you off, but finding that trust in the most unexpected places.which is why this book lies at the intersection of love and family. how family can feel like an anchor sometimes, but with the right person to to shoulder that weight with you, home can be freeing and you can find a family in your roots.anyway i have nothing else smart to say except (respectfully) excuse me? sorry. mommy? sorry. mommy? sorry. mommy? sorry. m—"
208,6,Delilah Green Doesn't Care,Ashley Herring Blake,208,2022-04-05,Rachel Reads Ravenously,4," 4.5 stars Delilah lost her mother, and then her father, at a very young age leaving her in the hands of her distant stepmother and stepsister. At eighteen she moved out and almost never looked back at the small town she came from. When her stepmother hires her as a photographer for her stepsisters wedding, Delilah can’t turn down the huge payday she’d receive for that work. And when she returns to her small town, she runs into Claire her former crush right away. The chemistry between Delilah and Claire is instant, but both of them have issues from their past that make it hard for what they have to be anything but casual.I have many thoughts and feelings about this book, mostly positive. It’s the kind of book where once you open it up you devour it. I liked all the main characters even if they all acted super immaturely for their age (late twenties/early thirties). This is one of the few queer romances I’ve read that doesn’t involve a coming out story arc which was refreshing (although I suspect the second book will revolve greatly around that). I love found family stories and this book fit that kind of. The relationship with Delilah and Ruby, Claire’s daughter, really pulled at my heart. I think all kids just want a cool adult who treats them with kindness in their lives, and it’s also what Delilah needed at that age and never got. There were lots of plot holes/unfulfilling parts of the book that bugged me which is why this book wasn’t a five star read for me. But I am very excited for the second book coming out this fall and grateful that my local book club selected this book as their April pick."

Jules? carried this entire book. i fucking love her. she’s so fiery it’s honestly inspiring. i had a lot of laugh out loud moments with this book and it was due to miss girl. josh? ok i experienced a lot of emotions when it came to him. at times i wanted to fuck him and other times i wanted to beat him senseless. this book became one of those books in which i fell for the female lead harder. i love josh and jules’ dynamic. they still had that fire even after that got together and i loved that shit. the josh and alex scenes were also so so cute like omfg the bromance 🥺i gotta say, i felt like chapter 46 was no unbelievably unnecessary for this book. like the shit that happened in that chapter felt so out of pocket that it made me feel a lot differently about certain characters than i did in the beginning. that’s why this isn’t rated a full 5 stars. nonetheless i really enjoyed the book and story. it feels like every book is getting better and better with this series like i can’t wait for twisted lies because the few scenes we did get with Christian already had this gorilla grip throwing punches. i NEED book 4 already!"

I HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATING JOSH & JULES SINCE TWISTED LOVE BUT NOTHING COULD HAVE PREPARED ME FOR THIS. ok let me stop screaming as I try to gather my thoughts. this mf book was everything. I have quite literally no complaints???? i really liked twisted love, and I adored twisted games BUT TWISTED HATE???? nothing compares. the way josh and jules had me in a chokehold the whole book!!!!! their A1 banter, their impeccable spicy scenes, their deeper connection.. I could go on & on. this was one of the very few books i’ve seen where the enemies NEVER lose their banter and their edge even after they turned lovers. I fell in love w jules ambrose and everything she’s been through, and josh mf chen? no words. I also loved the domestic scenes and the fact that we got to see alex & ava and bridget and rhys!!!!!! i’m SO EXCITED FOR STELLA AND CHRISTIAN I COULD CRY. 5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ if that wasn’t obvious enough. “still hate me?”“always” <3 "
213,7,Twisted Hate,Ana Huang,213,2022-12-29,jessica,4,"this is honestly probably the best enemies to lovers relationship plot ive ever read. like, it was palpable how much jules and josh didnt like each other. but it never got to the point where they were cruel. just the constant bickering and annoyances that happen when two people dont get along. so their connection felt believable and it made me want to root for their feelings to change, rather than their “enemy” scenes manifesting degrading and problematic red flags. the only thing that stopped this book from being perfect was jules’ backstory. it facilitates the classic “miscommunication” conflict that always appears at the end of romance books, but her history just isnt entertaining or interesting, so i dont think it really added anything to the story itself.but full marks for how the relationship between jules and josh played out. really well done.↠ 4 stars"

“You’re my personal hell, Red.” He gave my hair another sharp tug. “And God help me, I don’t want to fucking leave.”

y'all when i tell you that i wasn't ever excited for this book, i had zero expectations. i was ready to come here and give a hate rant. now look at me 🤡 me with my 5 fucking star 🤡. i gotta say whatever crack was in this book, i fucking want it bitches. ugh guys this won't be a 5 star read unless you are crazy like me bc i'm willing to neglect all the flaws in the book for josh ok. tbh the what the plot was? i don't fucking care about it. all i care about is josh 😻 my joshy boobo0 pants 🥺🤪. the way i can't even shut up about this man. i don't even want to shut up about him.  smut spoilers ahead  
“Beg for it, Red.” He curled his finger and hit my most sensitive spot, eliciting another moan, before he slowly dragged it out and shoved it back in. His breathing harshened. “Beg me to fuck you. To make you come all over my cock like you so desperately crave.”
the way my heart skipped a beat. this was the line that started my josh chen obsession. i read this and i was whipped for him. i couldn't even think straight. i was just so shocked because the other books even though had good smut, lacked to make me feel butterflies and just you know... this book, however, gave me everything. my actual reaction: 
“You feel so fucking good,” he growled. “You love my cock wrecking that tight little pussy, don’t you?”
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes. 
“The next time you want to insult me, I want you to think about this.” He withdrew until just the tip of his cock remained in my mouth, paused, and plunged down in one sharp thrust. I gagged again, the tears flowing faster, the heat in my belly stoking hotter. “You on your knees, gagging on every inch of my cock while I ruin your tight little throat.”
the way i'm still sweating for this man. i don't even have words just let me keep these quotes here, please. 
“That’s it,” Josh groaned. “Every inch, just like that. I knew you could take it.”
THE PRAISE KILLED ME. i love how he sometimes either praised her or degraded her. it was a nice mix. istg i was sitting here thinking oh god how i wanted josh chen to do all this shit to me. 
“We’d already had sex once tonight. That should’ve taken the edge off my need, but I was addicted to this. To her. Her taste, her smell, the little breathy moans she let out every time I thrust into her and the way her pussy clamped around my cock like it was made for me. I wanted all of it, all the time.”
ugh we love an obsessed boy <3 
“Most women thought men wanted them to taste like berries or lavender or whatever, but if we were eating pussy, we wanted to taste pussy. That was the whole fucking point.”

“Don’t make me spank your pussy next, Red.” I rubbed my thumb over her still-swollen clit in warning. “I won’t be as gentle.”
tbh @anahuang please next time dont be shy and make joshy boy spank her pussy... why did you tease me like that. i was so sad you don't even understand. 
“Because you’re mine,” I said against her mouth. “Let another man touch you, Jules, and you’ll find out just how easily I can take a man’s life as I can save one.”
get yourself a doctor who will kill for you even though he saves people. fucking goals tbh. 
“Now, she was beautiful in a way that made me want to drown in her, to let her fill every inch of my soul until she fucking consumed me. It didn’t matter if it killed me, because in a world where I was surrounded by death, she was the only thing that made me feel alive.”

“Such a good girl.” Josh rubbed a tear of frustration from my cheek. “You swallowed every drop of cum. That deserves a reward, don’t you think?”
i cannot believe i forgot this quote :) i'm shhhhhhhhhhhhhh anyways,  i'm excited for twisted lies bc its christian and he just seems very yummy BUT i'm not here for the insta lust. idk hope i'm surprised by the book like i was with twisted games but so far josh chen is my fav boy <3

217,7,Twisted Hate,Ana Huang,217,2022-06-07,gigi hadidn’t,3,"3.66 stars ⭐⭐⭐josh chen - ❝You like this, don’t you?” he growled. He stared down at me, his face taut with desire as he pumped in and out of my throat. “Getting face fucked and filled in every hole like a good little slut.❞me - 
🎶 I want you to park that big mack truck right in this little garage make it cream make me scream 🎶
🔥 the plot 🔥josh and jules hate each other. josh and jules decide they want to fuck. 🔥 things i liked 🔥🍆 josh chen and his dirty talk. i just know his dick is shaped like a coke bottle with the girth of a coke can. 🍆 jules being a sassy queen.🍆 the hate to lust, it was sheer excellence they really didn't like each other for the first 30% of the book and i enjoyed this part a lot more than i thought i would.
❝Jules is very pretty.” “Most flesh-eating succubi are. It’s how they rope you in.❞❝I was somehow not surprised Jules had turned the tables on her would-be mugger. If she got kidnapped, the kidnapper would probably return her within the hour due to sheer irritation❞
🚨 SPOILERS START HERE 🚨 - stop reading now if you have not yet read the book🔥 things i disliked 🔥jules entire backstory. allow me to explain. our girl jules here was kicked out of her house by her mother who believed that jules was seducing her stepfather. her and her then-boyfriend max to survive, steal money from unassuming men (one of which is when max makes jules fuck a guy, which he filmed, to distract him as he steals his money). they then decide to steal from jules's stepfather but max leaves evidence in the form of his blood behind so he gets caught and is sentenced to 7 years in prison, which jules is unaware of as after they escape she runs away. now fast forward to the present and maxy boy here finds jules and blackmails her with the sex tape. why you ask? not because she's a future lawyer and he wants her money. not for revenge for him getting caught and sent to prison. but because he wants a RANDOM ASS PAINTING THAT SOMEHOW MIRACULOUSLY DR JOSH CHEN POSSESSES... the reach... the imagination... the creativity... ana huang i simply have to stan you m'aam! if you guys thought the plot twist with ava/josh's dad in Twisted Love was crazy, this one right here is even better.villainous dads are so wattpaddy, give me an ex-boyfriend who wants to steal your current boyfriend's VERY RARE AND EXPENSIVE painting any day. 
❝The painting is one of a limited number that belonged to a famous European collector. It’s worth a lot of money in certain circles, but it was sold at an estate sale by mistake and switched from owner to owner until we tracked it down to your boyfriend’s house. Took a lot of paperwork tracing and bribes to get to that point, but we did it.❞
 - how did a man who spent 7 years in prison trace and bribe people??? who is WE max kjdskjsks???max had the potential to be a good villain but everything he said was super cheesy. he was all talk and no action. if he was really about that villain life, he would've uploaded the sex tape and texted it to josh period!!!but anyways so jules goes and steals josh's painting like a true little thief rat, but clearly, she isn't going to make a very good lawyer if she leaves a whole cyclone attack of evidence behind in josh's apartment. at least make it look like it's not a crime scene jules that's law 101, trust me i know i've watched suits and how to get away with murder. now there was a scene where after jules confesses to josh about stealing the painting, he makes her think she's forgiven but fucks her so hard and harshly whilst telling her he lied and she isn't forgiven jskdjkssk!!! i want to put this in my liked section so bad but for the sake of spoilers, it's staying here 💅
❝At least you got an orgasm out of it, so don’t say I never gave you anything. I’ll miss that tight pussy of yours though. No one takes my cock better than you do. It’s your best quality.❞
 - if josh said this to me i would simply combust, like me?? i'm the chosen one that can take your huge humongous dick all the way to the hilt????why thank you 🥰really the things i disliked were jules backstory, the length of the book, and just the overall pace of the book. by the time i reached 70%, i thought the book was almost over only to see i still had 150 more pages left to go 😭😭😭i mean 510 pages is a lot and is the length of most MZ books, but this was not a slow burn. if this was a 375-400 page book it would've been way easier to digest because i feel like we were bombarded with so much information, the last 30% of the book literally turned into some heist/action movie. 🔥 other characters 🔥alex - he should quit his day job as an assassin/ceo/billionaire and take up motivational speaking instead 😍
❝Everyone changes. Without change, we might as well be dead.” It would’ve been an inspiring quote had Alex not delivered it with all the emotion of a block of ice.❞ 
 stella - it's been 3 books and still the only thing i know about stella is that she is an influencer. i know this girl's instagram looks just like emily from emily in paris. i also think her plot is going to be her becoming a sex slave to christian for the cheap rent. go off queen, at least that way i can pretend to be interested in her. 
❝She’d worked out a deal with the landlord so she didn’t have to pay Jules’s portion of the rent for the remainder of her lease.❞
christian - kinda hot kinda scared. christian is a big name to live up to (see mr grey and mr allister), but i can smell the insta-lust and obsession already and i'd like to remind ana huang so far only christian from The Maddest Obsession has successfully pulled it off, so i will be watching you 👁👄👁🔥 overall thoughts 🔥
❝If you die, I die, Red.” I grinned and kissed her cheek. “Hell with you sounds like heaven to me.” Her tense expression cracked. “That was corny as fuck, Josh.” “Yeah, so? I’m hot enough to pull it off.❞
okay yeah, i have more dislikes than likes but i in good conscious have to rate this higher than avaalex, because joshjules ate them up. the banter, the chemistry, and the sex made up for the weird plot and long length so i choose a good balanced neutral 3 stars. like switzerland.🔥 twisted series ratings 🔥Twisted Love - 2.75 starsTwisted Games - 2 starsTwisted Hate - 3.66 starsTwisted Lies - tbr"

219,7,Twisted Hate,Ana Huang,219,2022-01-28,Phuong ✯,3,"– 3.25 starsTo think Twisted Hate was my most anticipated book of January lmao ... I don’t know what made me think this book could be a 5 stars (🤡), when I didn’t rate the other two books in the series higher than 3 stars either. I blame it on the “Let another man touch you, Jules, and you’ll find out just how easily. I can take a man’s life as I can save one” quote, there is just something a doctor who is willing to kill when he is suppose to do the opposite don’t judge 🤚 I don’t give a fuck that’s unethical, it’s hot. 😇 But lesson learned and I shouldn’t hype myself up because of one quote. Will I still read Twisted Lies? Sure thing. 😂I’m going to time this review so let’s see what I can come up with for Twisted Hate in 5 minutes, before I hit publish: – be aware might contain spoilers –🏮something about the pace of the book felt off for me, from the blurb I expected Josh and Jules to go right into their on-night stand and from there had that ‘frenemies with benefits’ arrangement, but it was actually super slow, cause nothing happened between them in the first 30%, except them insulting each other, which was fine the first 10%, but after that got boring. I wanted them to at least kiss, but crickets. 🏮Ana could have done so much with that skiing trip with Jules & Josh and even included the one bed trope, but it went nowhere. One chapter they were all sitting together eating lunch and Jules running to the toilet to puke and then the next chapter we jump right back into Jules being back at work after their weekend trip, which didn’t make any sense to me. The transition was just so bad and I thought I might have missed a scene or two. 🏮at least the Jules & Josh sexy scenes didn’t disappoint me and delivered. The hate sex between them especially the first time was explosive and that shit was good food.🏮but ngl I was a lil concerned at how much and fast Jules could orgasm... Josh only had to pump into her a couple of times and suddenly she came like 5 times in a row. Josh really knew what he was doing. 🤣🏮while I thought the first third of the book was pretty boring, I liked the rest of it much better when Jules and Josh opened up a little and they had some very cute scenes together. My fav one is when Jules mother died and she flew home, at the same time Josh had a trip planned to New Zealand, but he didn’t go and instead changed his flight to be there for Jules and surprised her in Ohio. My heart melted reading that scene! 🥺🏮okay maybe I lied, cause I have another fav scene: when Josh took Jules out on their first date and it was a bookstore scavenger hunt. I thought that was fucking cute, because the idea? the planning? the creativity? so sweet!! 🏮I didn’t like how Josh reacted when he found out how Jules deceived him, but I loved how Josh beat up Jules ex, the guy who pushed her down the stairs, not that one thing balance out the other, but it got me some satisfaction lol. 🏮cute contemporary romance, not bad, not good, but overall nothing special. On par with how I feel about the rest of the series, but for a contemporary romance it should have been over 500 pages long.

220,7,Twisted Hate,Ana Huang,220,2022-07-13,Matilda ,5,"4.5 red stars Josh Chen is so damn hot. The audacity of him to be this hot and for the smut to be as hot as it is. It’s rude actually.1. degradation kink
“You like this, don’t you?” he growled. He stared down at me, his face taut with desire as he pumped in and out of my throat. “Getting face fucked and filled in every hole like a good little slut.”
2. the praise kink
“That’s it,” Josh groaned. “Every inch, just like that. I knew you could take it.”

“Good girl,” I whispered. “Keep those screams in, Red. I’m the only person who gets to hear how much you love my cock in that tight little cunt.”
3. the hate sex 
I didn’t get a chance to respond before he slammed into me from behind with a vicious thrust. A scream ripped from my throat at the painful stretch of his size and the roughness with which he fucked me. Tears sprung to my eyes, but my scream eventually faded into a string of mindless whimpers and squeals as he pounded into me.“What was that?” Josh’s breath grazed my cheek. “You always have so much to say. Where are your words now, hmm?”

Anyone else’s loins getting warm? 
4. the. choking.
Josh’s eyes blazed hotter. His hand closed around my throat, and he squeezed. Harder and harder, until darkness edged my vision and I couldn’t take it anymore. I opened my mouth to gasp for air, managing to drag in one breath before he shoved his cock in.
The bickering between Josh and Jules and the way it carried on through the entire book…I mean what more could you ask for.Then the romance was just incredible 
“Twelve days, eight hours, and nine minutes. I spent every second thinking of you…I thought I knew what I wanted before. Becoming a doctor, chasing the next high. Being the most popular, most liked person in the room. I thought those things would make me happy, and they did. Temporarily. But you…” He rested his forehead against mine. “You’re the only thing that could make me happy forever.”
This is too much emotion 😭 please go back to calling her a slut, it’s safer that way

221,7,Twisted Hate,Ana Huang,221,2022-02-01,Warda,3,"Up until that irritating third-act conflict, this book was beautiful. It was hitting all the right feels points. I adored Josh and Jules.But that conflict. Could've easily, so easily, been avoided. It read like drama for the sake of drama. Let's just tear these two apart so there's a bit more angst and tension.No. I wasn't convinced. So, I skim-read and rolled my eyes away the last 30% of the book. It dragged, they both acted like imbeciles and there's only so much idiocy I can take. ------------------As of now, this cover wins. Indie romances coming through!"
222,7,Twisted Hate,Ana Huang,222,2022-01-30,❀ Rose ❀,3,"Update: we just had a scene with Christian and Stella in the same room and… I am combusting ——————-Damn you Anna Huang for making me excited about this😩😩 I’ve been seeing the teasers on Tiktok and I have to say… dis woman knows how to sell a bookP.s. this is coming from someone who wasn’t even sure if they were going to read this book or not… safe to say, imma read it now"
223,7,Twisted Hate,Ana Huang,223,2022-02-03,tasnim♥️,1,update: after doing a re-read I would give this book a zero but I can’t so it’s getting a 1⭐️ there’s a questionable consent scene in this book and it would be one thing if it was advertised as a dark romance or included the appropriate triggers but it didn’t… and idk how I feel about that. sex should never be weaponized and the fact that it was used as the “third act conflict” is something….anyways it was a quick dnf even though I had like 20 pages left.
224,7,Twisted Hate,Ana Huang,224,2022-08-11,Madita,1,If I could give zero stars I would.What the hell happened to Jules???Okay so I will be honest: Jules was this badass girl that I appreciated since book one so I kind of thought that she would be putting Josh into his place in this book and make him work for it. Spoiler: she did not. Maybe it’s just me but I thought that this was a completely different Jules especially after that “Plot twist” scene. It just didn’t make any sense to me. Now let’s talk Josh aka the biggest fucking asshole on this planet that did not deserve to get back without groveling. Now here’s the difference between him and Alex (slight spoiler below): Alex did what he did Bc he thought he was protecting Ava in the long run even if it hurt a bit. Josh purposely and directly wanted to hurt Jules where he knew it would be the most painful. That is completely different and look at what Alex did to get Ava back Vs what Josh did. Oh yeah he did nothing. Josh honestly lost all my respect after that scene and the fact that Jules took him back right after made absolutely no sense. Now the enemies to lovers was not what I thought enemies would be (spoiler below too) Josh cared not even 10% in. He was already talking about hugging and at the 50% mark he said “I never felt that for anyone expect her” as a response to how Alex described his feelings for Ava. HOW IS THAT ENEMIES TO LOVERS???they already weren’t enemies at like 10% and I just expected more slow burn but it was the faster than Rhys and Bridget which was forbidden I guess. I just can’t deal with Josh as well as how Jules acted in this book
225,7,Twisted Hate,Ana Huang,225,2022-01-31,Miriam Stern,1,"I can't, consciously, give this book more than one star. I'd love to, because I've genuinely grown to love Ana Huang, but I can't.I've hidden this review because there are so many spoilers. In fact, it's better to go into this book spoiled. Believe you me. A bit of context. The relationship between Jules and Josh has been hinted since book 1, where their banter and 'hate' is an obvious throw to one of the oldest tropes in romance: enemies-to-lovers. In this case, though, Jules and Josh truly *truly* despise each other. Jules is Josh's sister's best friend. He thinks Jules is a terrible influence on his sister. When this book begins, Josh and Jules are in their usual status quo of throwing verbal daggers at each other. Life throws them together when they both start work at the same clinic and that's when they enter into the truce that would eventually lead to them being together. Josh needs therapy. Seriously. 'Book 1 Josh' is not the same as 'Book 3 Josh' and maybe this is the reason 'Twisted Hate' does and doesn't work as a standalone. If you're just reading it because you picked it up, ignoring the previous two books, you'll miss out on a world of background. 'Book 1 Josh' is very laid back, a total man-whore and pretty chill about life in general. 'Book 3 Josh' has serious issues. He was betrayed by Alex, his best friend (which, honestly, it's not that big of a deal when you think about it and considering what truly happened) and his father landed himself in prison because he's an actual psycho. Josh clearly has a huge amount of pent-up feelings that would have benefitted from a therapist. In fact, it would have been an extraordinary element to add to the story. These obvious issues lead Josh down a fucked up rabbit hole that had drastic, and I mean, DRASTIC repercussions for this book. It goes downhill at about 72% of the book. Jules backstory is revealed to be sad and pretty screwed up. She had to thieve away in order to survive when she was much younger. It's not good, but Jules escapes from that life in order to pave her own way and become someone. The fact that Jules is hiding this dark past, does not bode well considering Josh's fragile psyche when it comes to, precisely, trust issues. You can see a mile away that it will not end well and things will get ugly. Up until this point in the book, however, it's going good. I mean, yes, there's the one bed cliché and the fact that Josh falls in love with Jules in a very quick turn-around, yet I can overlook all of this. Their sex is genuinely STEAMY and those first 'hate sex' scenes DELIVERED. It was working (at least for me it was). Then, Jules is blackmailed by her ex into stealing a painting that Josh has. Now, there are a few things I'm genuinely pissed about concerning Jules. Her best friend's boyfriend, Alex, is THE psycho and I'm sure that if she'd asked Ava for help, the problem would have been solved altogether. Secondly, she knows Josh is dealing with trust issues and she decides to come up with this insane idea of staging a break-in and then confessing it was her? I expected honesty from the get-go, to be frank. Jules and Josh have always been honest with each other, if anything else (even when they hated each other). This, however, felt uncharacteristic and a bloody stupid idea. Jules was wrong, yes, but what Josh does? Unforgivable.  Unforgivable. Jules ultimately confesses everything to Josh: her past, that she'd been blackmailed, that she stole the painting and his other things, that she had brought them back and the reasons why she did what she did. Basically, she comes clean to Josh. A little too late, yet she does it anyways and that does take a lot of courage. What does Josh do? The fucking worst. He says that he forgives her, has sex with her only to tell her ""I don't forgive you. I lied. How does that feel?"" That shit made ME feel dirty. You don't do that to someone you love, let alone someone you know has gone through an inordinate amount of shit. To make matters worse he references that the only thing he'll miss is 'her pussy', which further hammers the nail into the quintessential coffin. Josh was cruel. Horribly, deliberately, cruel, to a point where *I* stopped cheering for him altogether. I read another reviewer that questioned 'consent' under this whole scenario. I'm not going to go there, but I will tell you, it was underhanded and definitely wrong. After that moment in the book, I was just focused on finishing it and getting it over. I didn't think he deserved forgiveness, especially since he didn't do much to earn it anyways (just ask her for it). Jules shouldn't have forgiven him for that shit. Also, when Jules is hurt (because the blackmailing ex pushes her down some stairs), Josh treats her (in the ER- because he's a doctor), in the most detached and cold way possible. Despite this, he goes after the ex and beats the living shit out of him. This was, apparently, the catharsis he needed to feel better about the events he'd gone through in the past two years. Dude, no. YOU NEED THERAPY (and maybe Jesus). Also, I'd like reiterate that Josh is a doctor and he's not supposed to be beating people to the point of near-death. Alex... ALEX THE PSYCHO, is the one to stop him [you know things are bad when the actual psycho hero from Book 1 (and 'alphahole') is more human than the protagonist]. So yeah, excuse me if I really wish nothing good for Josh. Conclusion. Really disappointed and sad. I had great expectations concerning this book and they went right down the drain. If you decide to open the 'spoilers' in this review, you'll see that there are legit reasons for you to skip this book. I would, however, recommend 'Twisted Games' (aka Book 2 of the series). Rhys and Bridget are a wonderful pairing and well worth the read."

“Because the possibility of you is better than the reality of anyone else.”
Yes I’m just reading this series so I can get into Christian’s book. I hyped him so much in my mind, so he better not disappoint. Also, josh and Jules were okay. Crazy and messy, but it fits them."

On one hand, I absolutely loved the enemies to lovers trope, best friends brother trope, banter and chemistry that was hot🔥!! However, the whole third act conflict and what Josh said to Jules and how he treated her was an HUGE NO for me. I was so ready to give this book five gushing stars until this happened. 😔 Overall, this was definitely my least favorite book in the series and needless to say I will not be rereading it.⭐️⭐️⭐️"
234,7,Twisted Hate,Ana Huang,234,2022-01-21,Jenn (The Book Refuge),5,"*Thank you to Give Me Books PR and the author for a ARC of this book*The Third entry into Ana Huang's Twisted series is an intense Enemies to Lovers, Best Friend's Brother, and Office Romance all rolled into one. I was very interested to see what was happening with Josh and Jules after seeing their seething hate bubbling in the past few books. I really have enjoyed the chemistry this author is able to put into her relationships and I was very excited to see how this one played out. I am, in general, pretty skeptical of Hate to Love in contemporary romances these days because it's hard for me to believe that the hate has a reason and I get frustrated by how much vitriol is shared when I can't see the reason for it. In the case of Josh and Jules, I feel like the mixture of a very protective brother and a few misunderstandings back when the first met each other, mixed with the fact that these two LIKE to hate each other made it work.When they both end up working at the same place, Josh a resident doctor and Jules as a law intern, they try to have a truce. But really it becomes a forced proximity situation that bubbles up into some excellent banging. Like.. Really dirty times that we are expecting from Ana Huang.The few things a didn't like had to do with 2 things: there relationship was a secret for WAY too long, and when they had their 3rd act break up… I think Josh went too far. I was honestly disturbed by how he reacts to Jules. I know there may be character motivation for it… but it was still very hard for me to forgive him.The possessiveness and groveling he shows afterward are good and will probably work for a lot of people, but I just had to put it out there. The way he acts out was almost too much for me. Intimate manipulation is something I can't stand in a contemporary. Because it is so unsafe for both of them.Overall, this was still a great book, and Twisted Games may stay my favorite, but it was a great time. I can't wait for Twisted Lies.4.5/5 StarsTW: Abusive Parent, Stalking, Death of a Parent"
235,7,Twisted Hate,Ana Huang,235,2022-09-07,Anouk ♡,4,"I’m officially an Ana Huang fan!❤️‍🔥My expectations were high, and honestly, I still wasn’t prepared for this!🔥🥵Jules and Josh might be my favorite couple so far, I love their banter.I really need a Josh for myself 😩. 
(his dirty talkkk, girl)
The angst and smut was soooo good.I wasn’t the biggest fan of the ‘last conflict’ though.I didn’t agree with the way Jules handled the situation but Josh’s reaction was waaaay out of order. I mean wtf, that made me SO mad!I really liked the Josh & Alex friendship revamp-thing🥹❥ Some quotes:
“You’re mine,” I said against her mouth. “Let another man touch you, Jules, and you’ll find out just how easily I can take a man’s life as I can save one.” “Hell with you sounds like heaven to me.” “Twelve days, eight hours, and nine minutes. I spent every second thinking of you.”
"

 “I highlighted a passage in the case with more aggression than necessary. Josh and I made a surprisingly good team, but I didn’t fool myself into thinking our truce was a precursor to an actual friendship. Only a few things in life were certain: death, taxes, and the fact that Josh Chen and I would never be friends.” 
Twisted hate has been one of my most anticipated releases ever since twisted love came out and I met Josh and Jules in there. There’s just something about hate to love which has me ready on my knees and safe to say Ana didn’t disappoint. I loved the dynamic between Josh and Jules and tho I wouldn’t say it was totally hate and enemies cause there were parts where I felt the hatred was more on Jules side than Josh, I still enjoyed the book a lot.   “It was okay to reach for a life raft, no matter what form it came in. Mine happened to come in the form of Josh Chen.”   Josh Chen had my heart since book 1. I loved how he was aspiring to be a doctor cause I find men in uniform super hot, okay?😭🥵 There’s just something about a guy taking care of you (even if it’s his job) which like sets me off. I loved the banter he had with Jules and his protectiveness for Ava just was a cherry on top. I loved how caring he was towards Jules when she was on her periods and just how kind he was to his patients and how considerate he was. 
 “Now, she was beautiful in a way that made me want to drown in her, to let her fill every inch of my soul until she fucking consumed me. It didn’t matter if it killed me, because in a world where I was surrounded by death, she was the only thing that made me feel alive.” 
  Jules Ambrose is such a fun character to read. I loved how witty she was, how she had an answer to everything when Josh used to make fun of her, how intelligent and career- driven she was and just how amazing and happy she made me to read her PoV. I loved the fact that it was shown how her life wasn’t all full rainbows and sunshine and she had more to her than just being a law student and a girl who was feisty. 
 “I was on fire. Skin blazing, tears and drool pooling on the table beneath me, but it all burned so exquisitely I never wanted it to stop.”
The chemistry between these two were 🔥🔥🔥. There was so much chemistry, the banter was epic, their relationship just made a perfect sense. I loved their first kiss, the fire they both created when they got together and just how they were perfect for each other. 
 “I didn’t know what I wanted from her, but I knew I wanted her. I knew she haunted my thoughts and invaded my dreams until she was the only thing I could see. And I knew that being with her was one of the few times I truly felt alive.” 
Overall, I had a great time with this book and though I felt like some stuff was missing, it didn’t hinder my enjoyment. PS : We got to know who Stella’s love interest is in this book and might I just say *chef’s kiss* . I AM IN LOVE. He made one or two appearances in this book only but I have that shit highlighted cause holy fuck🥵🥵 im calling dibs on him bye bye.  *** ARC provided in exchange for an honest review. *** "

238,7,Twisted Hate,Ana Huang,238,2023-01-02,Karla Espinosa,4,"AMAZING!! I'm so sad I finished this series but I'm also so so glad I read it! After finishing all 4 books, I can tell you you right now that this series only gets better with every book. It's so easy for the first book in a series to be the best one and for the rest to not really compare. However, every single book in this series was amazing and I couldn't recommend it more! They all have their own separate tropes but in Twisted Hate, the trope of enemies to lovers is truly done right! If you were thinking of starting this series, stop thinking and read it! It's everything and more! "
239,7,Twisted Hate,Ana Huang,239,2022-01-21,Krista Baumgart,5,"ARC review- oh my god Ana what did you put in this book?! I cant give this book enough stars cause Jules and Josh had me addicted to reading this! This book is one of the best enemies to lovers books! We've been reading about Josh and Jules hatred for one another since twisted love... and it was WORTH the wait. The anticipation that has been built up in the first two books was so great that I couldn't wait to read this one. It was so interesting to see Josh and Jules together and how their hate had turned to such an amazing, caring and loving relationship. Josh has dealt with a lot considering everything that had happened in twisted love- we get it from Avas perspective, but in this book we see how the aftermath has affected Josh. How he is coping with his family, how he copes with loosing patients at work. Jules is one of my favourite new FMC cause she has dealt with so much in her life and strives to become a better person. She is apologetically her- she is confident, intelligent and strong. We learn about her history and her character growth on learning how to trust again. The tension, the spice, the caring... EVERYTHING IN THIS BOOK WAS AMAZING. Jules and Josh are my new favourite couple of all time and they deserve everything. true definitions of soulmates in book!!"

This is what a book written purely for tiktok looks like. Recipe for a book that is guaranteed to go viral on booktok:✔️ add 8329322 popular tropes✔️ secretly obsessed hero from chapter 1 disguised in a 'slow burn' book✔️ generic smut that should've been fade to black, because i would rather imagine the sex than read about a chemistry-less couple, it's just a waste of time 😵‍💫✔️ conflict that kicks in at around 80%✔️ the hero does a grand gesture to win the heroine back ✔️ cheesy/unique declarations of love 😍 My 2 stars are for the conflict (best part), honeymoon, and CAL 😍 but other than that I felt more reading my biology textbook at school than this. I'm sorry y'all but this is a very basic and generic marriage of convenience book. Where is the flavor in the smut? the tension? the slow burn? the gradual build-up of indifference to wanting to die for them?? sorry, but Rowan Declan was gone for Iris in CHAPTER TWO. And what was the point of making Iris black if we saw nothing about her heritage and culture? it's not even confirmed she is from Senegal, the only thing that was mentioned was her grandma having Senegalese twists (hairstyle), and I & Hala came to the most logical assumption 🥸There was another scene where Rowan Declan visited her family and they made him eat spicy chicken made with cayenne pepper... IN WHAT WORLD IS CAYENNE PEPPER SPICY?  (okay unless you are used to eating spicy food of course you will find it slightly spicy but Rowan Declan was sweating buckets), but only real ones know you cook with scotch bonnet for that HEAT. Well done for the token character to fill your diversity quota. 😍 It might sound like I'm nitpicking and authors have the right to write whatever they want in their books, but if you're going to try to represent a POC character, please make it somewhat believable and incorporate some of their cultural identity. Everyone who enjoyed this I really am so happy for you and wish I could join you guys on the love train but this did not give what y'all said it was supposed to give!!! thnx to my partner in crime Hala for reading this with me (even tho I got distracted and left you), there's no one else I would suffer with but you 🦭💸 Dreamland Billionaires Ratings 💸The Fine Print - 1.5 starsTerms and Conditions - 2 starsCal's Book - tbr"
244,8,Terms and Conditions,Lauren Asher,244,2023-01-19,ellie,1,"instead of being called Terms and Conditions, this should be called Copy and Paste.bcos this felt like The Fine Print in a slightly better font. slightly. and the main reason i finished this was for all of the Cal and Alana crumbs, bye💀 i felt that this (and The Fine Print) were both extremely repetitive. to the point that neither book had me hooked in the slightest. i kept putting this aside to do other things and wasn’t desperately inclined to keep reading. it got to the point i skimmed so much bcos i was incredibly bored and felt like i was reading scenes i had already read in both TFP and in this book. it had the same repetitiveness resulting in me thinking “i swear i have read this encounter already within the book?” “that’s definitely already been said?” “surely not this AGAIN?” there was just so much back and forth of Declan being a shitty robotic husband and said something rude to Iris, Iris sulks for 0.57483 seconds while rambling in her inner monologue how she’s “gonna show him” and make him suffer... only for him to look at her like 🤨 while saying something mildly sarcastic that she thinks is the funniest shit in history, then she forgives him and they repeat the process all over again :) literally all he had to do was mention his dead mother and Iris was rolling at his feet like a good lil lap dog. but i think the repetitiveness of the book stems from the complete lack of plot. what was the end goal? the driving force? it felt too aimless with Declan and Iris just having basic interactions with zero stakes. there was nothing to cause any real conflict or tension. Lauren Asher relied on the romance to do so and it worked initially but quickly lost its momentum. 
”Another one?” he grumbles before shoving a handful of popcorn into his mouth.[...]I hit the mute button, silencing the TV. “Do you have a problem with that?”“You’ve watched eight episodes in a row of them doing the same exact thing.”“And I could watch another eight more without ever getting bored.”
Declan legit could have been talking about this book bcos yes, he and Iris did the same exact thing constantly again and again, just like that damn tv show. but unlike Iris, i couldn’t read any more without getting bored. well, bored is an understatement.i did, however, i like the romance in the beginning. but i had issues with it. the basic tropes were low-key my fave. the grumpy-sunshine dynamic of them. the fake marriage tropes. the classic tension-filled unbuttoning of the dress bcos the heroine can’t reach the back. shit like that. can’t pretend i didn’t enjoy a lot of these interactions. were they cliche? absolutely. but were they fun?! absolutely. now my main issue was both characters are infatuated with one another from chapter one. the book really is insta-lust/attraction masquerading as a slowburn. they were way too comfortable for a fake couple from the get go— at their rehearsal dinner, for example, they both have no qualms or fumbling awkwardness to being touchy feely and intimate. there’s no buildup? they already have this easy-going relationship. you’d think there’d be some fumbling, some stiffness, uncertainty and awkwardness with their first public appearance as a “couple” but there wasn’t. so it was just boring. 
I take a step out into the light before I’m stopped by Iris pressing her palm against my cheek.She removes her hand, but I latch onto it and press it against my chest.My thumb brushes the inside of her wrist.She wraps both of her arms around my waist, drawing me toward her. Our bodies fit together like two interlocking puzzle pieces.
this is all from their rehearsal dinner and i found it all waaaay too easy. they’re so casually touchy feely and i found it jarring. there’s no build up to this. i can’t help compare it to Rose and Jack from Marriage For One where they were so damn awkward when they made their first public appearance as a couple in a fake marriage. and yes, Jack and Rose were strangers while Iris and Declan have history... but he’s her icy-cold, stoic older boss and they’re not that close. sure they banter back and forth but this? idk, i wasn’t convinced. it was unsatisfying bcos the tension, the awkwardness and the buildup is the best damn part!!it was just completely uninspiring. both the characters and the romance. bcos Declan felt like Rowan, and i truly don’t know who i disliked more? and Iris laughed as much as Zahra did and man did it erk the fuck out of me😭 then the fact Iris’s sole personality trait was being Declan’s assistant didn’t really help her case either. she was so flat and generic. she legit had no life. no friends. no hobbies. no passion. all bcos she worked for Declan and that ate up all of her time... and she didn’t see an issue with that?? and the whole thing with her job interview??? i– no words. 
She looks down at her plate. “Turns out people stop inviting you places when all you do is say no.”“Why did you say no?”“We lived two very different lifestyles. Most of my friends had nine-to-five jobs and worked only five days a week. At first, I tried to keep up with them, but eventually I was burning myself out. I had to choose between my job and my life, and we know how that went.” She motions toward me.
it’s also hard to root for Declan, and Rowan in the first book, when their whole capitalist vibe is constantly present within the book. it’s not easy to root for two guys who are aware of the shitty wages, working conditions, etc of their employees yet don’t really give a fuck bcos it doesn’t benefit them or the company. like Iris says this so casually:
Welcome to the Kane Company where employee wages are as dismal as company morale.
it’s so bleak and disturbing, honestly. especially as a person who lives in a working class town, raised and surrounded by working class people, it’s hard to look past the Kane’s mindsets. idk why the author includes it tbh? i have read too many CEO-type romances in my life but never any like the ones Lauren Asher writes where im fully aware and uncomfortable with the amount of wealth the H has. i think bcos it’s so emphasised not only how rich they are but how shitty their workers are treated that makes it so nauseating and stark. like this quote. idk if it was supposed to be charming and swoony? but i just found it gross:
By the time the auctioneer steps away from the podium, I’ve spent over fifty-million dollars solely for the rush I get whenever Iris smiles.
maybe pay your workers above minimum wage before throwing your money around willy nilly. usually in other CEO romances, we see the douchey rich guy but not much else beyond his sphere of wealth. and he usually gives to charity and holds charitable events etc that makes him a little more human. but seeing how the Kane’s wealth impacts the lives of the people they exploit... not the type of hero i like ngl. Rowan in book one only changed his tune to appease Zahra since she was one of the “poor people” he was “saving”. if he hadn’t met her, he probably would be the same capitalist douchebag we first met. now he’s just slightly less of a capitalist douchebag. Declan does do some sort of sponsoring thing with kids. so yeah that’s cute and all, but you can do that AND give your workers a decent living wage so they can afford to, you know, live :) idk maybe im just in a silly goofy mood tho. and not Iris basically flinging her panties at him for doing the bare minimum of human decency when she finds out he sponsors kids despite JUST saying how bad the wages and morale of the workers are in his own damn company😍she spent most of the book doing that tbh. just letting him get away with the bare minimum and never holding him accountable. then the little scene at the hospital where he demands Iris have a private room bcos “money is no object” and that the nurse needs to understand this is the “real world”🙄 he was annoyed there was so much noise of people moving throughout the hospital... sir, that is how all hospitals function. i was legit there on Wednesday for one of my annual appointments and it was the exact same— they’re loud, they’re active, their bustling. waving your money and arrogance around as though it makes you better than everyone else? stfu please. he says Fuck this place and the people in here. “We’re leaving.” bcos Iris has to share a room for like 2.68444 seconds while she gets her injured hand checked out. he truly acted like the hospital was a cesspit and that everyone was grossly below him... which i suppose, in his mind, they are. but damn, trying to root for him when he acts like that is almost impossible. questioning the doctor’s capabilities. being rude to nurses. making snuffy comments about how the hospital is ran. Declan, sir, your privilege is stinking up the waiting room so why don’t you just fuck off, yeah?? some people might say im being nit picky and this is just a romance so im thinking too hard about things... when the author includes that sort of thing, it’s hard for me not to notice it. i can’t look past shit like that bcos it distracts me from the romance. if i don’t like the characters as people, then rooting for their romance is impossible for me to do. and the way Declan treats Iris during the inevitable conflict was just the final nail in the coffin for me. i was just skimming by that point and didn’t even know why he was being so mean... but i didn’t like him enough to care lol. so in the end i was kinda fed up with this book. the only thing that truly kept me going was my baby Cal. stole the show hands down. any time he was on page, Declan and Iris who??? i can’t wait for his romance... Cal and Alana second chance romance WHEN?!?"
245,8,Terms and Conditions,Lauren Asher,245,2022-01-12,Nura,5,I've had time to comprehend this book and I still stand by saying that these are the only terms and conditions I will ever willingly read. I never knew I'd be leaving a peace of my heart with Declan and Iris but I guess I missed that part in the fine print. -the only time i'll ever read the terms and conditions is if it's written by lauren

""I want to leave this world before you because I can't imagine having to go through a single day without you.""
Crying, screaming, throwing up because I don’t have my own Declan.Terms and Conditions is the second book in the Dreamland Billionaire series which follows Declan and Iris. If you love age gap, marriage of convenience, boss/employee with lots of tension then this book is perfect for you! This book follows Declan who has to complete his grandfather’s inheritance clause by getting married and having a family. Declan needs to find someone to marry him and Iris, Declan's assistant, steps up and agrees to marry him so he can get his inheritance. The more time Declan and Iris spend together pretending to be in love the more the lines blur and things start to feel real. Declan and Iris are the definition of soulmates and I enjoyed every page of their epic love story. The tension between them was amazing. Watching Declan the grumpy businessman go soft for Iris was just perfection.I 100% recommend this book and all of Lauren Ashers books!*ARC provided in exchange for an honest review*"
248,8,Terms and Conditions,Lauren Asher,248,2023-03-11,Madita,3,The last 80 pages ruined the book for me.WTH happened? 
249,8,Terms and Conditions,Lauren Asher,249,2023-01-08,SK,3," ""DaisukiSzeretlek Ich liebe dich""  So after deliberating on it for a few minutes, I'm gonna give it 3 stars. Here me out, I went in with extremely low expectations, to the point that my expectations were in a negative. I admit, I fully wanted to trash talk this book cause of The Fine Print. But it did impress me a fair bit, in my opinion 3 stars is not a bad rating. Or maybe the Fine Print was so bad, it makes Terms and Conditions look good 🤷‍♀️It is a decent, enjoyable read. Let's go over the  tropes- ✔️Dual POV✔️Marriage of convenience ✔️Workplace romance✔️Grumpy x sunshine✔️Forced proximity✔️Interracial couple✔️Billionaire romance✔️Fake dating It's lighthearted, not over the top unlike the first book in the series which is so full of cliches that you would want to gag. Don't get me wrong, there's a fair amount of cliches in this one too but it's balanced quite well.  One of my favourite scenes  from this book would have to be when the couple help each other in dressing up- with Declan zipping Iris's dress up and Iris helping him with the bow tie. It's such an underrated, and sweet moment it made me swoon. When it comes to the couple,  Declan  is by far the better one. Even though he presents a tough exterior, he's a marshmallow at heart for Iris. He's ready to open up, try new things just for her. He's willing to put in effort and that's so sexy in a man. The only off putting thing about him that I found was when he thought of Iris's ass as ""globes"". I found it creepy, immediately made me put the book down for the day *bleh*. It was giving women written by men vibes. Honestly, Lauren Asher should know better being a woman herself. It's disgusting 😭😭Coming to  Iris,  initially I found her to be quite likable, intelligent and such a humorous personality. However, once I got into the second half of the book, I realised that there's zero character development in her. She's stubborn, selfish- extremely and has no regard for Declan or his feelings whatsoever. Some of the things she did in the last 25% of the book were shocking and manipulative. For instance- as Declan's assistant when she screwed up in the workplace, Declan had every right to be angry and correct her. But what she does is victimize herself, cause she has dyslexia (which FYI Declan was not being rude about) but she continued to throw drama over it for so many pages and unnecessarily victimizes herself. She proceeds to manipulate Declan to grovel for forgiveness. I mean the man raised a very good point-  ""So, this is how it's going to be? You're going to punish me whenever you don't get your way? What's next, withholding sex because I did something stupid like comment on your job performance?""  It's quite an assessment of her character and 100% right. She proves that multiple times in the second half. Compared to Rowan and Zahra, Declan and Iris have better chemistry, and intelligence. But Zahra and Iris are no better than each other in the end. Also, can I add how Zahra's presence annoyed me a lot in this one? Pfft. Another character that started to bother me in the second half was Cal. He is too biased and has no original thought of his own, sort of like Iris's pet. I'm worried about his book tbh.Anywayyy, the 70% of the book is quite well written and enjoyable. It's what happens in the last 30% with too much of Zahra (for me) and Iris' bitchiness that I dropped my rating from 4 stars to 3. It does have its moments, highs and lows but overall it's decent. Its a hit or miss kind of book tbh. You'll either like it or absolutely hate it. I'm probably going to read The Final Offer when it comes out, hopefully it's got likable characters."

251,8,Terms and Conditions,Lauren Asher,251,2022-02-26,Sanyah(Taylor’s Version),2,Declan annoyed me so much with his rudeness and the whiplash of his moods. Please attend therapy for your daddy issues. Iris was sweet and she didn’t deserve to be belittled like that for all the years she worked for Declan. 
252,8,Terms and Conditions,Lauren Asher,252,2022-02-28,hala,1,"✩ 1.25 stars.i was struggling with this book from the beginning but kept going for cal’s scenes. it was a disaster for me, to be honest. i genuinely highlighted nothing but some of cal and iris’s dialogues which were the most entertaining for me.☁️ declan was a carbon copy of rowan plus the mommy issues. it felt to me as if the author didn’t know which route to take with his character. she wanted to make him this hot grumpy asshole with an impenetrable cold exterior when he just came off as plain and boring… declan, babe, have you ever considered therapy? ☁️ i wanted to like iris so much and i seriously tried! but somehow she reminded me of zahra from the fine print who i wasn’t a fan of. to me, terms and conditions is another version of the fine print but with a couple of changes.declan: *breathes*iris: HE’S SO FUNNY! *proceeds to trip on air from laughter*☁️ for the romance, it’s hard to detect any because unfortunately, i didn’t feel the chemistry between declan and iris. when i expect a marriage of convenience, boss/employee romance, i think of angst, jealousy, TENSION, and trying their best to deny they have actual feelings for one another! here, it was insta-lust and you could just tell from chapter two that declan was infatuated with iris. if he’s already head over heels this early on then what’s the point in me reading the rest of the book? i wasn’t able to see the connection between them (except for maybe their past but? what did they bond over? what did they do except go on fake dates and annoy me with mr yakura. couldn’t care less!!)what i liked about this book: <3 callahan kane <3
”Cal breaks through the crowd and raises his drink in the air. “Family therapy is on Thursday nights. Don’t be late!”
i knew he was going to be my favorite since day one. so far he managed to not make his whole personality based fully on his father. he is actually interesting. i really hope his book is better than the fine print and terms and conditions. alana and cal better give me the second chance romance i need from them!p.s. read this review for some laughs <3"

“Ya'aburnee. As in you bury me. A rough translation for the way I want to leave this world before you because I can’t imagine having to go through a single day without you in it.”

y'all i was so ready to give this a 3.5 but that last chapter... fucking SAVED it. don't get me wrong, it was WAYYYYY better than book 1. it started out so well too that i devoured it. BUT BUT i'm still a little disappointed because i did think that we'll have daddy declan grow and mature through a family, like the contract said... but we never got a daddy declan :) and that's what pissed me off.  yes after sleeping on it, i don't remember shit so minus a point hehe. 
tropes:- age gap- grumpy/sunshine- marriage of convenience & fake dating- best friend's brother- workplace (boss/assistant) - hero falls first - hero doesn't care about sex until her- slowburn- forced proximity - family drama (daddy and mommy issues)- jealous and possessive hero
the tropes in this book complemented each other, i really think it matched their vibes. i didn't think it would be such a slowburn but it kinda was? i just kept thinking ""when y'all gonna fuck already"". i also found zahra still very annoying so i was bored when she showed up and was saying bla bla bla ugh. BUT i do think that i liked declan way too much so i'm upping my rating for him because the shit he does. 
“Every look.” The unsteady beat of my heart floods my ears. Her breath catches in her throat as I cup her cheek. My thumb strokes her soft skin, rubbing back and forth like I could brand my name with touch alone. “Every touch.”“Every single kiss…is nothing but a lie.”
THE WAY THIS WAS IN CHAPTER FUCKING TWO. i was instantly hooked and couldn't stop reading because HELLOOOO???
“Fake marriage or not, Iris is destined to be with one man and one man only.Me.”

“Talk about her like that again and I swear I’ll make your last twelve months as CEO absolutely miserable.”

“If I had it my way, you would wear an ankle monitor so I could always know where you are.”
we love a possessive hero. we LOVEEEEEEEEEEEE this way too much... i was just oh my... he's hot when he's all woof woof on people. 
“What are you doing?”“Helping my wife.”My throat bobs. “You’re growing a bit too comfortable with that nickname for my liking.”“I use it to remind you of your place.”“And what’s that?”“Mine.”

“We could have one kid or five, so long as you only have them with me. I’ll give you the minivan life, solely if you want it.”
bitches come and go bruh. but you know i stay. where do i fucking find a declan? heheheh please :) i'm begging you please :) PLEASE PLEASEEE. 
“I could spend the rest of forever with you and it still wouldn’t be enough time to finish everything I have planned for us.”

“Daisuki.” His deep thrust makes me gasp.“Szeretlek.” He presses his lips against my forehead. My pulse flutters at the gesture, sending a rush of pleasure all the way to my toes.“Ich liebe dich.”

“Ask me why I hate when people use Times New Roman instead of Arial.”“Are you serious right now? What does that have to do with any of this?”“Because I chose it for you.”“Want to know why I kept the cactus?”I nod.“Because it was the first time someone got me a present that made me laugh.”“Ask me why you were denied the job transfer.”“Tell me you didn’t.”“I couldn’t let you go.”
yes i did tear up for them :) but like in a happy way you know... IDK why i cry at stupid shit like this but when someone dies i'm all :|.... IDK OK. ok now for the cal talk... I CAN'T WAITTTTTT for his book. i mean he's the only one who doesn't have any mommy or daddy issues. THANK FUCK. he's also just so fun and cool that idek how he's related to these grumpy men. ugh <3 <3 <3 <3"

257,8,Terms and Conditions,Lauren Asher,257,2022-06-30,Anouk ♡,1,"I can’t stop thinking about Christmas dinner with the family.🎄Between Zahra’s belly laughing, Iris’s wheezy laughing, 2 men who mostly refuse to smile at all cost and 85 children by that time, it’s going to be a hoot. I don’t know the story of brother 3 yet, but honestly, is it going to make this family more sane? I’m not holding my breath. Ok, I’m clearly not a fan. FYI: This ‘review’ will most likely be a rant (a long one) with major spoilers. First of all, this book is basically ‘The Fine Print’ with some small adjustments. I wasn’t that exited about the fine print, so I wasn’t really planning on reading it twice. And honestly, this one is worse. I was going to give it 2 stars because I think I smiled twice or something? I also thought it was kind of cute he made everyone use Ariel because he read that it was an easier font for people with dyslexia. But I changed my mind because honestly this book doesn’t really have a storyline? Like what’s the point? We’re going back and forth a bit and that’s it. It’s also toxicity at it’s finest. Let’s get this small annoyance out of the way first. Chapter 2 (Declan) and Chapter 3 (Iris); They are already going on and on about how they get warm and fuzzy over a laugh, and how they are trying to keep their feelings to a minimum. ‘I shouldn’t touch her like this, it blurs to many lines’.Why? You’ve known each other for 3 years and have never had any romantic feelings or moments together whatsoever and now all of the sudden someone laughs and we’re losing our mind? How? Why? What changed? Also, why should I care? I don’t know you, we’re on page 19.But my biggest issue with these books is the ‘character building’, if you can really call it that. The men are both in their mid thirties, they are so completely emotionally dysfunctional, to a point where it’s hard to believe. I know there are pricks in the world, but Declan and Rowan are the most one-dimensional ‘I’m an asshole and I don’t want to change’ characters I’ve ever seen. Apparently there’s not a single person in the world that likes them and they want to be alone for ever and ever.Until a woman blinks at them or whatever and they lose all control of their emotions. How does that make sense. Especially with Declan and Iris since they’ve known each other for years and now all of the sudden he’s always been in love with her. No, you weren’t? Why change the story halfway through the book? I also have an issue with the women in these books, mainly because they laugh at everything. Luckily Zahra laughs like Santa Claus and Iris laughs like she has a lung disease, so we can tell them apart. But seriously, that’s 90% of their personality. Until they have the tiniest thing to be upset about, like this scenario towards the end of the second book:So, they got into an argument, like their first one. Iris immediately thinks about ending her marriage, jumps on his private jet and leaves without telling him, refuses to come home, refuses to talk to him and quits her job. They argued because he is angry that his abusive father is trying to sabotage an important business deal they've been working on for years. She said he wasn't handling it the right way, he told her to stay out of it and he's still the boss (which honestly, valid. Yes, you’re a team, but also, you’re his secretary and you don’t have the credentials to be the CEO of a billion dollar company) and now he’s ‘using her learning disability against her’ and he isn’t worthy of her because apparently he’s the biggest menace on the planet. Seems like a well balanced, reasonable reaction. Of course we find out Iris was right all along, despite it actually being his job, so logically he should know how to handle a situation like this and she really has no a clue as this is NOT HER JOB. I can't. And then they really saved the best for last..there’s this comment in the last chapter:“Anxious Declan is my favorite Declan because it’s the version of him no one else knows about.”Please tell me you didn’t just say the favorite thing about your husband, the love of your life, is his anxiety, which showed because he was waiting for your approval and he’s scared you’re gonna run again because he thinks that he’s unloveable. Literally his own words. Unlovable. How is this romantic. I’m not going to talk about both epilogues, because I don’t like them and I don’t want to."
258,8,Terms and Conditions,Lauren Asher,258,2022-02-15,San (slikestoread),5,"5 Gunnen stars!“I will always love you. Today. Tomorrow. Forever.”Tropes: Age-Gap (iris 23/24, Declan late 30s), marriage-of-convenience, grumpy-sunshine, work-place-romance, billionaire romance Terms & Conditions delivered and it was everything I was hoping for and so much more! Terms & Conditions was my favorite read of February. Iris & Declan have left a deep mark on me and it will be hard to move on and wait for the next book. Lauren’s writing gets better and better as she goes, & get ready because she’s taking you on an unforgettable ride. So hold on tight, after Terms & conditions, you won’t be the same. BEST BOOK OF THE MONTH, AND PROBABLY ON MY TOP FIVE OF 2022. At this point I’m convinced that my love for Lauren’s books and her characters keeps growing like the vines of Iris’ plant. I’ve been waiting for this book before Lauren even confirmed it was Iris and Declan, so I was beyond excited to finally read it. It didn’t disappoint, if anything it left me wanting more of Iris & Declan because I couldn’t get enough. The book starts with Declan looking for a wife to fulfill his grandpa’s clause. The book picks up at a very good pace, from the very beginning you are captured by Declan and Iris, and as the book continues with Iris & Declan getting married we see how their relationship grows and cultivates into something beautiful and meaningful. In the book we get an insight of Iris’ & Declan’s past, and we also get to see their character growth. The book was truly perfect from starts to finish. THE EXTENDED EPILOGUE! That’s all I’m saying. Let's talk about Iris! So, I’ve been in love with Iris since she first appeared in TFP. I knew there was something so special about Iris and she was perfect in every way. Iris is one of those book characters that will stay with me for a very long time. Iris is very young, but she is so insightful and so strong. We are able to get an insight of Iris' past, and Iris is one of the strongest and most determined people I know. Life has thrown so many challenges at Iris, but she prevails like the queen she is. I love the representation that Iris brings in the book. I don’t want to spoil anything but we need more characters like Iris that make people feel seen and give hope to others. AND IRIS IS A PLANT MOM. She’s truly perfect, I would become a plant just so Iris could take care of me. Also, Cal & Iris were one of my fav things of this book, their friendship is something I didn’t know I needed until this book. Declan, Declan, Declan. I’ve been intrigued by the eldest Kane brother since day one. Uhh, Declan is the definition of a book boyfriend. Declan is sexy, grumpy, oozes powers, and he loves so intensely. Similar to Iris, we get a glimpse of Declan’s past, and let me just say I’m not a fan of Seth Kane—never was & never will be. Declan’s main goal in life is to become CEO of his family’s company and when he decides to marry Iris he is one step closer. In this wild road trip called marriage, Declan discovers there is more in life that he wants to become CEO & he is not afraid to go after it. I loved Declan from page 1, but I loved his personal growth and how determined he is to go after what he wants.This book was truly perfect. Also, Lauren spoils us and she gives us appearances of Rowan, Zahra, and CAL! I loved Cal so much and I’m ready to submit my application and get interviewed to become his friend. Zahra & Iris' moments were so perfect. I’m starting a petition for a crossover for the final book of the Dreamland series, please. --------------------------------------------------------June 2021 Terms & conditions? umm... this sounds like Declan & Iris to me! pls pls pls & thank you. I ship them so hard already.Possible tropes: Marriage of convince/Arranged Marriage (Declan needs to marry), Age Gap (Rowan mentioned Iris is younger than Declan), Office Romance ??? Why Iris & Declan are endgame:  1. ""Iris grins as she sets up Declan's breakfast in front of him. Despite my brother's best efforts to remain professional, his eyes slide from me to Iris's skirt"" (Oh, Declan is definitely interested!) 2. ""She & Declan work together seamlessly.

259,8,Terms and Conditions,Lauren Asher,259,2022-11-30,Phuong ✯,3,"– 3 starsThe 30% of Terms & Conditions were a 2 star read. Did this book magically get so much better? No, it did not, but my mood did. This book proved how much of a mood reader I am. Iris (h) ↠ I have no idea why I liked her, but I liked Iris a lot better than Zahra. Maybe it’s because she tried to punch Declan’s father in the face and broke her hand doing it. Yes, I think this has to be it. Declan (H)↠ He was the older and more bitter version of Rowan. Declan and Rowan’s name could be changed it would be the same story. 
Declan is far from perfect in many ways, but that doesn’t make him a bad person. He doesn’t yell at me or call me names or make me feel uncomfortable.
You know the bar is low, when Declan does the bare minimum and gets praised for it. Declan & Iris↠ the thing is, I didn’t particularly love Iris and Declan as individuals, but together they were (kind of) cute. 
“Stop fighting and give me ten minutes.” “You don’t deserve ten seconds, let alone ten minutes of my time.” “How about ten words then?” I laugh. “I’d like to see you try.” “I am falling in love with you, Iris Elizabeth Kane.”
↠ I started to like the book when Declan made up his mind in the second half and decided to chase Iris. The trope where the guy falls first always hit some kind of way and when all the little things Declan did for Iris over the years were revealed, I’m soft. Especially the font scene. Ugh my heart!
“Ask me why I hate when people use Times New Roman instead of Arial.” “Are you serious right now? What does that have to do with any of this?” “Because I chose it for you.” “I’m sorry, what?” “I read somewhere online that sans serif fonts are easier for people with dyslexia to read, so I changed my requirements. Forced everyone else I oversee to switch with me or else they would face my wrath. All because I wanted to help you.”
↠ I love it when a couple has these insider jokes that is exclusively theirs. Declaniris exchanging foreign words to express their feelings for each other was so cute. Not only do I learn new words, but the feeling when you look up the word and it’s something to swoon about *chef’s kiss* 
“Don’t go telling anyone else or they’ll be disappointed to find out it’s only for you.” Looks like the reporter was right. Declan does have a soft spot for me after all. “Why?” “Forelsket.” His raspy whisper makes me feel like he shares a secret I can’t decode.
Conclusion
Cal’s gaze narrows. “Don’t look at me that way. I don’t have nearly as many daddy issues as the other two.” “That’s because you have a whole host of other problems.” “It makes me layered.” “No. It means you need to seek therapy.”
me @ all the Kane brothers: you don’t need to lead a multi-million dollar company, you need to get help for your daddy issues.┍━━━━━━━━»•» «•«━┑

I love the story so much it is so good I am obsessed with it. Let’s start off with Iris everything to do with her I’m obsessed with. I’m obsessed with her wearing bonnets to sleep, I’m obsessed with her outfit, I’m obsessed with her personality I just love her and I see so much of myself and her! The way that we see Declan grow throughout this book is absolutely beautiful, I’m obsessed. The progressive of the relationship to me was absolutely necessary and I absolutely enjoyed every step of the way. I love all the push and pool all the compromise and everything in between! The epilogue and the extended epilogue are absolutely fabulous, and the way that Declan proposed at the end had my heart through my hands. I really love Cal’s involvement in the storyline and how he is Iris‘s best friend and I’m very excited for his book! This book was perfect for me and for that I gave it five stars!"

I’m crying up over here rn because Declan is a fictional man and it’s sad that he doesn’t actually exist because I mean THE ENDING AND HIM THROUGHOUT THE BOOK. God man, let me just kneel and done 🧎🏻‍♀️🧎🏻‍♀️🧎🏻‍♀️🧎🏻‍♀️. The way Declan grew in her was just amazing. The difference between him at the beginning of the story to the ending… was absolutely good. He had a huge character development. Miss Iris really did her magic on him.  IRIS ELIZABETH LANDRY 🥵🥵😩😩😩 Ma’am can you please step on me. Dear Lord, I love this woman with all my heart. Black women during BLACK HISTORY MONTH…. Damn authors really do know how to serve us.She’s such a badass and a softie at the same time. I’m just love her shoes and her personality and her iconic outfits😩😩😩Sorry Declan but you stood no chance at not falling in love with that woman. I loved her friendship with Zahra and Cal and I was rooting for her n Cal at the end. Her simping and fangirling over Santi 😭 (babe you just like me fr). I loved how we got a mention of the Dirty Air series in this. I was screaming out my lungs. Can we just appreciate their love language 🥺🥺🥺. Them texting each other words in foreign language and him confessing in it 😭😭😭😭. The tropes: ✨Age Gap (12 years)✨boss X employee ✨marriage of convenience ✨grumpy/sunshine ✨force proximity The epilogue and extended epilogue absolutely served. Could now see why Katherine Pierce said ""It's ok to love them both"" ""I did"", but guys I love all three brothersOverall….. THE STORY WAS EPIC I cannot wait for Cal and Alana’s story… I mean second chance romance????? Count me in."
266,8,Terms and Conditions,Lauren Asher,266,2022-08-05,Roz,4,"3.5 ⭐️ rounded up 3 🌶 I liked this MUCH more than The Fine Print. I LOVED IRIS!! the reason I read this was because of Iris and honestly, I'm happy to say that I loved her so much! THE PLANTS!!!! and her family! 

“Is now a good moment to tell you about the time Iris set a church on fire?” Mom grins.

they're the best and I wish we got to see more of them, they're so funny! 

I never admitted to him why I broke up with my ex a year ago. Declan probably thought we parted ways amicably, but the truth is Richard asked me to marry him. I declined. He cried.

QUEEN IRIS MAKING MEN CRY!!I liked the plot of T&C much better than the fine print. It might be the marriage of convenience and the slow burn!! they added sooo much tension and with the chemistry between them, so good!Delcan is... think Rowan but grumpier. that's really all I can say. dumb rich grumpy man 😂Overall, this novel was actually very good! The reason why it's a 3.5 and not a 4 is because 97% in, he said something that made me mad (I won't talk about it now) but it’s nothing bad, just a certain word the author chose for the scene…since I enjoyed it up til then, I gave it a 3.5 and rounded it up!read if you like:→ Workplace Romance (billionaire boss/ assistant)→ Forced Proximity → Dual POV→ Grumpy/ sunshine→ Explicit open-door romance→ Steamy romance→ Disability Rep→ Best Friend's Brother→ Marriage of convenience → Fake Dating (after marriage)→ Age GapI'm reading the third book because I LOVE Cal, he's probably the only Kane man I'll love. We'll see...TW: abusive fathers, death of a parent (mentioned), substance abuse (alcohol), anxiety and panic attacks."
267,8,Terms and Conditions,Lauren Asher,267,2022-07-01,Jessica ,4,"Nothing like a grumpy billionaire! This book definitely had a slow start and it took me about half of the book before I really got into the story. For me, Iris really stole the show in this book and I really loved her character. I loved how she pushed back against Declan and how she was super close with his brother Cal. I also loved how Iris had dyslexia and how sweet Declan was about her difficulties reading. I don't want to spoil anything, but what he did made me swoon. I love a good marriage of convenience, so I really loved when they were living together and actually fake dating in order to get people to think their relationship was real. Declan is definitely super grumpy, but it was cute when he initiated some of the dates and really started to fall for Iris. Overall, the second half was definitely much better than the first and I had fun with this marriage of convince, grump/sunshine romance! "

Song - Wellerman by Nathan Evans
Why do I always have to be the hater? I refuse to believe the 4.40 avg rating. Something sus is going on🤨Will be following tradition and writing in the format of my first review.
HANNAH
💿 The supporting character (no matter how much they wanted me to believe otherwise)💿 Passionate for music & vinyl records💿 Hopelessly infatuated with her Russian boss Andrei (or was it Sergei?)💿 Aspires to make playlists for movies💿 Rich LA girl but acts poorHANNAH'S VIBES:1) 2) 3) 
FOX
🦀 Designated fuckboy 🦀 Perfectly stunning, blonde, and sun-kissed🦀 Has hella issues🦀 Got a better taste in music than Hannah (yes I listened to every single song mentioned. It was my only shred of happiness during this time)🦀 Deserves a moment of silence because this man was lost to us from page one (to Hannah and his denial)FOX'S VIBES:1) 2) 3) 
CHRISTIAN
👑 One of Hannah's colleagues👑 The main character👑 The moment 👑 Everything Hannah wished she was👑 I just know he carried that whole movie as much as he did this bookI would like to additionally say that Christian made a total of maybe three appearances.

“I hate that I like you.” “I like that I hate you.”

CHRISTIAN'S VIBES:1) 2) 3) I included Christian's little........mood board? Because I wanted to start this review on a positive note. And I think I've made it clear enough that he was the only entertaining or interesting addition to this book. Being Hannah's frenemy led to some hilarious interactions. And before any of you go building ships and whatnot🛠️🚢 he's gay. 

“What are you drinking? Poison, I hope.” She pursed her lips and perused the various liquor bottles. “What can I drink to give you a personality?” Looking pointedly at her dress, Christian gave an appreciative snort. “So, what are you, like, trying now?” “Could you do the same, please? It took you sixteen takes to nail four lines of dialogue this morning.”“Can’t rush perfection.”

Dare I say the most offensive quote of this book🢁. Why? Because the gall of Hannah to say CHRISTIAN has no personality when he exerted more of it in the 2 seconds of page time he was given... than her - the apparent ""main character"" she was soo desperately trying to be. 

Hannah Bellinger had always been more of a supporting actress than a leading lady. The hype girl. If she’d lived in Regency England, she would be the second at every duel, but never wield the pistol.

Both characters had their own personal issues to deal with. Whereas Hannah was struggling to be a leading lady (and failing), Fox was extremely insecure in everything that isn't sex due to being objectified for so long. If you think the heroine will contradict herself with time by becoming less of a hype girl and more of a main girl. You're in for disappointment. Her entire purpose this whole time was being Fox's support system/therapist, which is where the main problem stems.As cute as this story was, it was also unbearably boring.I couldn't form an attachment to any of the characters. I found Christian amusing and there were times when I could relate to Fox but other than that...there was a big hole in place where interest should've been. Is it bad that whenever the main couple was left alone I kept hoping Segrei (or Andrei?) would pop up and we'd get to see the boss jealous😩. ME... no.1 hater of Russian men WANTED the Russian man, and he wasn't even that interesting. It actually got worse. As Fox had Hannah pinned against a wall, in a full make-out sesh, I am completely zoned out thinking of best gifs I could use for Christian😭😭That is how dry the romance (actually everything) was. I just wanted dramaaaa. Which is ironic because I thought It Happened One Summer was a lil too dramatic. Now that I'm rereading the synopsis, I guess we did get what it was pitching, in a very lazy lacklustre way:1️⃣Friends to lovers? Yes except Fox was already head over heels in love since the prologue. Friends where?2️⃣Dating advice to entice OM? There were maybe two dumbass advices like ""hey maybe bite ur lip more?"" and she never even used them.3️⃣Jealousy? Delivered in a very dispassionate way. I just didn't really care because he was already so much of a simp, it was bordering on pathetic how much he drooled over her.4️⃣OM drama? NOTHING. Nothing that matter anyway.5️⃣Rom-com? Idk I might be wrong but wasn't this supposed to be funny...6️⃣Hot hot smut? The sex scenes are a mystery to me because I skipped them all. Oopsy so sorry. It seems though, every time time I decided to not skim I just had to encounter words like these:

“Drop the oil, wet girl”“I know what you like now, freaky girl.”“How’s your tush?” He cupped the buns in question. “Sore, I bet.”

Took a pic of my face while reading all of the above as evidence of emotional distress. fkng try n beat me in a court of law now.BUUUUUT! You know what we did have? 7️⃣self-sabotage on top of self-sabotage on top of self-sabotage from Fox. That was what the story started, continued, and climaxed with. IN CONCLUSION: The best part of this book was the prologue."
271,9,"Hook, Line, and Sinker",Tessa Bailey,271,2022-05-01,Ayman,5,"my heart is so full. ok so i honestly didn’t think going into this that i’d be walking into a tsunami of emotions. i was hollering, screaming, crying, and dying. 🤬🥹🙄🔥😝😝🥶i’ve said this before and i’ll say it again: if there’s one thing i love, it’s a broken man that doesn’t know his self worth but then he does all thanks to the woman. gets me every time. 😋😋😋one thing i appreciated from this story was how complex it was. i was legit crying for this man, my heart was aching for these characters. i liked how this book had a more realistic and emotion-filled approach. the tension and chemistry these characters extrude was potent. it was tangible. i was fucking feral. i’m talking -wringing out the mattress, foaming at the mouth, biting ankles- feral. one thing i love, is a man that has it BAD for her and that was our very own Fox. he wants her SO bad “i’m so ready for you. been aching so long.” i was fucking giggling into my pillow. this man has my undivided attention yall 😩✨ and the dirty talk he’d do? “You want me to spread you out on the bed and use my tongue on that pussy, Hannah? say the word and i’ll do the rest. all you have to do is slide your fingers into my hair and hold on.” like SIR ?!? i was letting out moans y’all 🫦🫦🫦 Hannah is a baddie with a fatty😤. i love her so much. she’s so smart and confident. i loved her “leading woman” behavior. 😉 i was screaming at the top of my lungs when she’d put Fox in his place. Yeah you fucking tell him bestie! make his ass grovel. make him feel the pain of his actions. fuck him up and leave him desperate for the air you breathe. if there’s one thing i love, let it be a man that worships the ground a woman walks on!!! queen shit 😏😶‍🌫️⭐️🫦😭💖🔥😫💥🤸🏽🤩🥵✨and that epilogue at the end was just the cutest thing ever!! i wanna live in that epilogue 🥰🥰🥰"
272,9,"Hook, Line, and Sinker",Tessa Bailey,272,2021-09-13,jessica,5,"this book has no right being this amazing. this duology as a whole is seriously god tier.this particular installment will speak to anyone who has ever seen themselves as the support, rather than the main character, in their own story, to the people who always have the perfect song for the mood they are in, to those who struggle with imposter syndrome, and to the ones who always believe in those they care about, even when they dont believe in themselves. this story oozes charm and heart and sweetness and understanding. its the perfect embodiment of the younger bellinger sister. and honestly, i love how hannah prompts and encourages fox to grow. usually the female characters are the ones who goes through the development in romance novels, so its beyond refreshing to see the guy be the focus instead. foxs character development is so wholesome and purposefully combats the societal pressures men face when it comes to maintaining a certain reputation and image. its a topic that definitely needs more attention. this is a wonderful follow up to ‘it happened on summer’ and gives a heartfelt send-off to the bellinger sisters. a massive thanks to avon books for the ARC!!↠ 5 stars"
273,9,"Hook, Line, and Sinker",Tessa Bailey,273,2022-05-17,Nilufer Ozmekik,5,"Wow! I was already intrigued by supportive, quirky, sensible, musical prodigy Hannah and heartbreaker, charming, flirty Fox at “It Happened One Summer”. They might have been supporting characters of Piper and Brendan’s love story but they truly deserved their own book. And thankfully Tessa Bailey answered our prayers with this spectacular cover and most emotional, tear jerking, sweetest love story! Hannah always considers herself as supporting actress, not a leading lady. She thinks she’s hype girl as her sister Piper always demanded the spotlight ( we already witnessed how her influential efforts resulted with more heartbreaks) since their childhood. And Hannah patiently waited in the wings, waiting for her right time to be announced as best supporting actress. She was always the one who was bolstering the heroine at her lowest point, taking care of the situation, fixing things! But enough is enough. She wants to take risks: coming clean with her long time crush bohemian director Sergio about her feelings and her passion to work at the musical department. She doesn’t have to work as production assistant forever! She needs to make changes! But she misses her sister and her time she spent in Westport. Maybe she also misses the charming king crab fisherman she’s been texting for seven months. Luckily she convinces Sergio to carry the last movie’s production location to Westport from L. A. But Piper’s parent in laws’ visiting at the same time forces her move to this charming fisherman’s spare bedroom! Yes! The flames are blasting! She puts more gasoline into the fire! Since they spent time at the convention center and he bought her Fleetwood Mac’s Rumors album, she couldn’t get him out of her mind. It seems like Fox felt the same: they already started seeing fireworks: but both of them were too stubborn to talk about their feelings.  Fox suffers from imposter syndrome. Even his coworker, best friend Brendan doesn’t trust him with Hannah. Everybody in the small town thinks he’s just a manwhore. His parental issues and an unfortunate incident at the college changed his perspective to the relationships. He’s always doubtful about his own self worth and he thinks he destroys anything he touches. But seeing Hannah in his own apartment, getting jealous to see her with her precious douchebag director change something in him!  Hannah and Fox’s story is more intense, sentimental but also heartwarming than I expected. Especially seeing the vulnerable side of Fox affected me deeply.  Hannah might be my favorite character of the series from the beginning. I always loved her more than Piper.  I was thinking to give four stars to this book but ten years later epilogue filled my eyes in tears so I added additional half star to round up 4.5 to 5 sweet, teary, touchy, trust, love, self worth, bravery, second chances stars! Special thanks to NetGalley and Avon and Harper Voyager for sharing this digital reviewer copy with me in exchange my honest opinions."
274,9,"Hook, Line, and Sinker",Tessa Bailey,274,2022-05-25,Yun,4,"Is there anything Tessa Bailey can't write? I feel like with Hook, Line, and Sinker, she has cemented her status as a must-read author for me.From the moment Fox and Hannah met, there's always been a little sizzle of attraction there. But between Fox's reputation as a ladies man and Hannah being the younger sister of his friend's fiancée, it doesn't seem like a good idea to take it further. Now they are solidly in the friend zone, texting every day and sharing their deepest thoughts. But when Hannah has to stay with Fox for a few weeks because of her job, will that finally nudge them towards being honest with their hearts and each other?I thought the beginning of this book was just adorable. There was so much tension between them as they went around pretending they were strictly platonic friends with each other. Hannah even has a lingering crush on her boss, and Fox has to give her advice on how she can go about trying to snag him. It was so much fun and I about died with delight.But then we reach the middle of the book, and I feel like it kind of lost some steam for me. Instead of the usual snappy pace, it just went on and on. Fox or Hannah would come up with yet another reason (or the same one) for why they can't possibly be together, and we just went in circles, again and again.To be fair, I always think I'm going to love the friends-to-lovers trope so much more than I actually do. When I think of other books I've read in the same vein, I always end up a bit lukewarm by the end. It's because there just isn't 300 pages worth of material you can fill on two friends who clearly have the hots for each other, but are either too slow or hung up to actually realize it. So to make a big conflict out of the whole thing, minor reasons must be dragged out to the max, and that's what happened here.Usually with Tessa Bailey romances, I feel like I have to make a note of how steamy they are, lest a new reader go in unawares and combusts in front of the pages. But this one didn't feel that hot. I don't know if it's because the story dragged on a bit and so the tension wasn't as high, or if the hotness level was a notch down from the usual. Either way, it's still steamy, just not as scorching as I normally associate with Tessa Bailey.I feel like this all sounds a bit negative, but it really isn't. Tessa Bailey can write the heck out of anything, and she definitely makes this story as interesting and heartfelt as possible. So in terms of this being a delightful read, there's no question. But even her writing chops cannot overcome a trope that just isn't that exciting to begin with. But even within the confines of that, she still wrote my favorite rendition of it. And that says a lot.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:It Happened One SummerWindow ShoppingHot & HammeredFix Her UpLove Her or Lose HerTools of Engagement~~~~~~~~~~~~"

276,9,"Hook, Line, and Sinker",Tessa Bailey,276,2022-03-13,elisa,2,"i'm sorry but i cannot be expected to take seriously the emotional journey of a straight white man whose inner angst centers entirely on being too hot + objectifying women his entire life in an effort not to be objectified first. like. HUH??? there was definitely room here to make some meaningful commentary on hypersexualization and its detriments to developing brains, but fox's entire arc was literally, ""because i've been sexualized for as long as i can remember, i am enacting vengeance by treating every woman i encounter as an object......until one i like comes around and i realize that women (specifically one of them) ARE people who bring more value to life than simply sex."" the amount of eye-rolling this novel induced!!! trust commercial romance to do one thing and one thing well: flatten and water down any semblance of complexity in its main characters. i really enjoyed the first book in this series because i felt it didn't take itself too seriously and hit all of its emotional beats with relative seamlessness. with hook, line, and sinker, i've had to write up a small laundry list of pet peeves:• given the book's title, it's not unreasonable for me to expect the leading man to live up to his reputation, especially when his first name is fox and the book at one point describes him as ""the maestro of feminine wetness"" (HUUUUHHHH!?!?!?!). and yet this man CANNOT SEDUCE FOR SHIT!!!!!!!! not an ounce of wit. no charm. not even a little bit suave. fox is the kind of conventionally attractive person who has never had to develop a personality to get what he wants and it shows. he's been carried by his blond genetics.• the biological essentialism in these books goes crazy fr. what the hell is this:
""Men like to feel useful. It stirs up our precious alpha male pride. Find something heavy and tell him you need it lifted. You will have emphasized your physical differences and thus, the fact that he's a man and you're a woman. Men need way less prompting to think of...[sex]""
i cannot believe someone sat down, created fox, and went, ""yup, that's normal and needs no addressing at all."" heterosexual a/b/o is so strange.....• at one point, over the course of a single interaction, fox addresses hannah by name not once. not twice. not three times. SEVEN. TIMES. sometimes one line of dialogue after another. normal people do not talk like this!!!!! what are tessa bailey's editors doing?• one of the pet names that fox uses on hannah at one point (in what is supposed to be a spicy, belly-tingling moment of foreplay) is........................wet girl. wet. girl????????? i almost want to dock a star from my rating for this line alone:
""Drop the oil, wet girl,"" he said. ""We both know you don't need it.""
WET GIRL!!!!!! tessa bailey can't keep getting away with this.• just read this pls:
How could his father bring women over while his eighteen-year-old son was visiting?
this is what fox's trauma boils down to.........this and his mom giving him condom money from an early age. 😫😔🤣😧😐 moving on.• the prose in this is harrowing. 2/10. please take a workshop taught by talia hibbert. rating is more like a 1.85/5. fox thornton, you will never be brendan ""your pussy hits better than my dead wife's"" taggart from the first book in this series."

An obsessive friends to lovers that makes you crave more of their angsty story filled with two characters from different worlds that collide in the best of ways...
After reading the first book in this series, I knew I was going to love Hannah and Fox. Their starting banter is what makes them the ideal couple to fall in love with. They know what they both want, but are stubborn to admit their true long past feelings towards each other. But with time they both learn that their attraction is not the only thing in they way of them being together. And even though Fox has a past that prevents him from admitting and opening up towards Hannah completely, and not just physically, his struggles to admitting that she is the one is what draws the reader to continue this story;

 ""She felt like the runrise coming up over the water after a bad storm..."" 

Without further to say, Tessa Bailey knows how to truly make you obsess over her characters. A healthy obsession that will have your toes curling for much more to come. ARC kindly provided by Avon Books, in exchange for an honest review...Follow Me On:Instagram ♕ Twitter"
278,9,"Hook, Line, and Sinker",Tessa Bailey,278,2022-03-02,Phuong ✯,2,"– 2 starsIt’s a rare case of it’s 50% me and it’s 50% the book.After reading It Happened One Summer, I wasn’t excited about Fox and Hannah’s book in the slightest because of the friends-to-lovers trope. It’s more of miss than a hit trope for me and Hook, Line and Sinker didn’t manage to change my mind. Turned out Hannah and Fox were as boring as I expected them to be. Was there mutual pining? Yes. Was there jealousy? Yes. Did I feel anything reading it? Nope. You can say what you want about Piper. Does she has 5 brain cells max? Hell yes, but that girl was so entertaining. Fox and Hannah ehhh... snoozefest from the prologue til the epilogue. The other thing that was just not done well is the relationship progression between the characters. It was so slow and Fox’s insecurities and problems were getting repetitive. Every time I thought the romance would finally go somewhere, it would backtrack just as quickly. Can we just get to the smut already, I don’t want to read about how Fox is such a commitment-phobe and for what? All because he cares too much of what people think of him. ConclusionReading this book made me miss Piper and her recharging station. 😔┍━━━━━━━━»•» «•«━┑

“Do you ever get so happy, you can barely stand it?”
Tessa Bailey created absolute magic here. She seems to be getting better and better with each new release and this one more or less owns me. It was so heartfelt and vulnerable. She crafts and cracks these characters wide open and she brings forth all of their insecurities, their quirks, their flaws and shows you who they are. You can't help but fall for them, you can't help but root for them. It was all so beautifully done. I became sick with feelings. I felt way too much for these characters and I loved it. 😪———————————This has just become one of my most anticipated releases of 2022 and I had none."

“You make me feel like I’m in the exact right place,”

I’ve read quite a few of Tessa Bailey’s books, and although I’ve enjoyed every one I’ve read, none of them have had that five star favorite quality for me… until now. Hook, Line, and Sinker was the perfect romance for me. I loved everything about Hannah and Fox’s story! Hannah is Piper’s sister and doesn’t feel like the leading lady in her own life. She’s back in Westport helping with a film and it feels right to be there. Back with her sister, back with Fox. Fox and Hannah became fast friends while she was in town before and have stayed in touch. Fox has a bit of a reputation, but he’s so much more than what he seems. While in town, Hannah stays in Fox’s spare room. It’s fine… they’re just friends. While Hannah has a little crush on a coworker, Fox decides to help her out by being flirty with her to give a little more attention to her. When that flintiness turns real and real feelings get involved, they both have some big choices to make.

“I didn’t know what right felt like until you,” he choked out. “I’m holding on to the good you give me. I’m holding on to you.”

Though I had so much fun reading this one, one of my favorite things about it was seeing the characters so exposed, vulnerable, and unguarded. They really got to know the raw and real heart of each other and though they had mad chemistry, it was that honest heart connection that really did it for me. They both saw a side of each other that others don’t see and the way Hannah stood up for/protected Fox was absolutely everything! If you enjoy friends to lovers, want a good rom-com with the perfect amount of emotion, and are looking for a sweet and steamy read that’s a lot of fun, pick up Hook, Line, and Sinker. This one completely stole my heart and I can’t recommend it enough!"

I had high hopes for this after loving book 1 but even though this was good, Fox and Hannah didn’t draw me in like Piper and Brendon did. It’s surprisingly slow for a Tessa Bailey romance and this is the first time I’m gonna say I wanted more steam in a book by her. We have a former playboy hero who realizes he’s fallen for his new best friend but he’s terrified of his reputation ruining things so he keeps her in the friend zone. It’s still a really sweet friend to lovers romance but it was just missing that charm from book 1 for me.***Tessa Bailey is giving me the friends to lovers romance that I NEED!"

This is the second book in the Bellinger Sisters series by Tessa Bailey. While the first book focused on the romance between Piper and Brendon, this second book focuses on the romance between her sister Hannah Bellinger and Fox Thornton. What will happen when two platonic friends decide to live together? The author tries to explore this scenario through this book.
What I learned from this book 

1) How can you have a main-character moment in your life? 
Main-character moments are those moments in which you are in charge of whatever is happening around you. The author tells a simple yet powerful way to create such a moment in your life. “The main-character moment?” ""Yeah. You know, when you've got the perfect mood going, soundtrack to match. And you're on a rainy road, feeling dramatic. You're the star of your own movie. You're Rocky training for the fight. Or Baby learning how to merengue in Dirty Dancing. Or you're just crying over a lost love.""  
2) Why should you never laugh at other people? 
Laughing at other people is a method used to humiliate others. It publicly shows your empathy level and consideration for others if you sardonically laugh at and slander someone publicly for their failures. “Laugh with them, instead of being laughed at. Make the joke, instead of being the joke.""  
3) How to stop worrying about what other people think of you? 
The anxiousness about being liked is one of the biggest problems youngsters face in the current era. It is difficult to escape from falling into the bandwagon effect of likes, shares, and followers trap if you are a social media addict. Never try to become a perfect person (perfection is an illusion). Try to find out your best qualities, focus on them, and live according to them. This might be a romance novel, but the author somehow managed to convey this inspiring message brilliantly. ""You can't live life worrying about what people will think. You'll wake up one day, look at a calendar, and count the days you could have spent being happy.""  
My favourite three lines from this book 
 “You make me feel like I’m in the exact right place.”  ""I could tell by the way you looked at her, she was something really special."" ""How did I look at her?"" He was afraid to find out. ""Ah, son. Like a summer day showing up after a hundred years of winter.""    “There was never going to be a life away from you, because, Jesus, that's no life at all.”   
What could have been better?
Tessa Bailey has the ability to gather our attention to anything she writes due to her amazing writing skills. Her books are generally entertaining to read. I liked how she decided to use the smut at a moderate level in this book compared to her first book in this series. In my opinion, this book had everything to call it better than the first one. But in this novel's middle portion, the author lost track of her writing, and the writing felt dragged without much content. Either she should have appropriately edited the central portion of this book and decreased the number of pages, or she should have taken some more time and effort to write those portions.
Rating 
 3/5 Even though there are some inconsistencies in writing it is still a fitting sequel to the first book in this series."
284,9,"Hook, Line, and Sinker",Tessa Bailey,284,2022-04-10,abigail ❥ ~semi-hiatus~,4,"4.5 starsLet me just start off by saying that this book is in a 
~different league~
 from the first. Completely different dynamic in the best possible way. I didn't enjoy this book's predecessor which was Piper and Brendan's story, but I knew from the get-go from reading that book, that I loved Hannah & Fox and couldn't wait for theirs.This is a forbidden crush to friends to lovers and it was incredibly addicting. If you have ever felt like you take the supporting role in life rather than being a leading character, you will find connection with this book. Always being the advice and therapist friend, never fully feeling like you have the confidence to take strides over your life. It will touch those who feel like imposters when stepping into things as well as accepting the reputation the people around you see you for instead of paving your own path.This story really snuck into my heart and had me fully engrossed and attached to these characters and their destined love. Hannah is one of my favorite types of female characters. She is a strong individual, yes with insecurities, but when she believes in something—nothing stands in her way. She was the defining character to Fox's growth overall, and constantly showed her faith and trust in him. His character development was beautiful to see and seeing his struggles with societal pressures and reputation only made you fall deeply more in love with his vulnerability and openness with Hannah.Ending this duet in the best possible way with a ten year later epilogue that showed us a glimpse into the life of both Fox & Hannah and Piper & Brendan leaving you teary and touched.
Thank you, Avon and Harper Voyager for this ARC!

286,9,"Hook, Line, and Sinker",Tessa Bailey,286,2022-06-18,aly ☆彡 (sick),2,"After the polarizing reviews I've been seeing around, you don't know how bad I wanted to be on the good side. I know friend-to-lover, in general, is a missed for me, but I do put strong faith in Tessa to turn the table with Hannah and Fox. I refused to believe that Tessa Bailey could disappoint me until today. Hook, Line, and Sinker is literally if not the most — one of my anticipated 2022 reads. The outcome? Underwhelming. I usually would lay it out on what I like about a book first, but I don't think I have anything to bring to the table for this one. Not even the smut could save it. I either roamed or skipped it through as there weren’t much of the plot to cling to.

""I'm good at being... supportive""

Well, realistically speaking, there is a reason why you're the supporting character in the first book. Obviously, not everyone can be the 'leading lady' and Hannah just proved why. I'm not sure if it's either that she was forgettable in IHOS or this feels like reading a different character who despite the 'reconstruction' is still one-dimensional and the blandest I've read from Tessa. I thought she was cool with being the side chick, who does not care for the 'spotlight.' What happened to the actual plot? 😭

""If you're laughing with them, they can't laugh at you right?""

I'm not stone-hearted, because I do feel sorry for Fox. Having people to put a label on you, especially with your daddy issues. It can be bothering. However, as clear as day, Fox's insecurities were frequently exploited to carry the conflict and is inadequate to support the entire plot. It's becoming cryptic. I understand that this is supposed to serve as character growths, and despite the confident demeanor we've seen, Fox surely had a massive self-loathing problem. And I am empathetic on any other day, but somehow, it's so easier to judge a character when they do questionable stuff — so, if I have to be frank, I find it annoying. He could've pulled his head out of his rear end sooner than intended. It's not like Tessa made him stand for himself with the insult or anything. His arc wasn't fully redeemed as it should have which made it more exasperating while reading his POV. Characters - Failed ❌Maybe the romance can be the saving grace. Guess what? Still no. ❌Is this a friend to lover? Because I think we needed to dig into a lot deeper emotional connection for it to be more potent. All the same, we know Hannah and Fox only spent one summer together and started to text each other before the battle not to get physicals began. Hence, you can't blame me if I didn't buy their chemistry. Relationships are hard work. Having bosoms and rock-hard abs do not make a partnership. Last time, the insta lust work for Piper and Brendan. This time, it doesn’t. Not to add, the push-pull relationship here is chaotic and emotionally draining. For the last part? It’s just another recycle plot from Tessa since she sure likes to make her heroes chased their girls abroad. And we also have Hannah who finally had her own business to work on… just like Piper again with Cross and Daughters — which is definitely a no problem but again: is getting repetitive and predictable. Conclusively, while I don't like this book, I don't really hate it? The epilogue is adorable but disappointed is still such an understatement. I am more pep up when Piper and Brendan came to pages than Hannah and Fox do. Lowkey wanna give this a star, but I’m being generous and allow Tessa one last chance to vindicate herself. Tough luck."

But despite that, it felt a bit lacking. Where was the juicy smut Miss Tessa?! I thought the playboy would have more to show for himself but you made him soft (I did not mind that too much tbh). It was sweet to see Fox get jealous. Hannah was there too; compared to Piper- Hannah felt dull and didn't outshine. Fox easily carried this book for me. There was repetitiveness in the conversations. Hannah and Fox go back and forth with their ""friend pact"" in the middle and it just dragged on unnecessarily in my opinion. But it's still a fun book. To see them yearn for each other, root for each other and have fun with each other make the couple seem so good. But yes, I agree- there's no beating Brendan and Piper."

289,9,"Hook, Line, and Sinker",Tessa Bailey,289,2022-03-09,Chelsea (chelseadolling reads),3,"3.25ish stars? This was one of my most anticipated releases of the year, and while I did still enjoy it, it didn’t quite live up to my expectations. In It Happened One Summer, the snippets we got of Fox and Hannah’s friendship were EVERYTHING to me, but I was pretty let down by the way their relationship ended up playing out in their own book. I understand why Fox was hesitant to open himself up fully to Hannah, but that doesn’t mean that I liked it, lol. Also, the super unnecessary third act conflict in this one drove me bonkers. With all that being said, this was still a Tessa Bailey book so of course I did enjoy it (and the smut was of course, A+), but this as a whole just did not quite do everything that I was hoping it would and I am pretty bummed about it. Here's hoping her next release works a little better for me!CW: death of a parent, slut shaming"
290,9,"Hook, Line, and Sinker",Tessa Bailey,290,2022-04-27,Anna,4,"I love love love Tessa Bailey as a human and I’ll always read her books. But I was definitely prepared to be disappointed by this one!There are a couple of reasons for that. The first one is that one of Hannah’s main character traits is that she is very into music and is very nerdy about it - which is great! I just… don’t think that can be an entire personality? Idk! I mean, I feel like most people are very into music, and we’re all nerdy about the artists that we love the most. So I was a little annoyed that this had to be a thing with Hannah. Like, we all love Fleetwood Mac, chill out!The other thing that was making me nervous was Fox’s whole deal; basically, he was just so hot that people always assumed he would be a womanizer and conditioned him into thinking he would never be able to commit (or be worth commiting to).And yet, even though both of those things were very prominent in the book, I still LOVED IT!!!Hannah was such a highlight for me. She was so fun and compassionate and witty, the friend of all our dreams. The story starts seven months after It Happened One Summer; this whole time, Hannah and Fox have been texting every day and nursing tiny crushes on each other. Now, the movie Hannah’s working on as an assistant producer is heading to Westport for filming, and she’s about to move into Fox’s guest room for the duration.This was truly so fun and funny and steamy and I absolutely loved Hannah and Fox’s dynamic. So flirty and cute the whole time. How many more Bellinger sisters can we get?? I want all of them!!!"
291,9,"Hook, Line, and Sinker",Tessa Bailey,291,2022-08-14,Hannah B.,2,"✨I am SEX hear me ROAR✨I despised nearly every aspect of this experience. This is my third Tessa Bailey book and it was my Hail Mary. If the main character having my name couldn’t save it, there was no hope. It actually went so far as to make me hate my name! I’ll never read one of her books again and I think it’s about self preservation at this point. I’ll be saving us both the inevitable negative reviews. The writing style is pretty much the exact opposite of what I want it a book.On the surface these characters have depth but underneath they were very very flat and unoriginal. They each only had one hurtle to overcome, one thing to change throughout the entire book. Neither one of the main characters was at all unique or did anything new for me. Their conversations felt weird and a lot of this book had me thinking I was listening to YA. Their texting conversation at the beginning was 15 minutes long (I listened to the audio) and it was very very juvenile. I didn’t learn much besides the fact that the tone it set for the book was one I’d have to crawl through broken and bleeding to get past the finish line. Hannah wanted to make a career in movie music without her stepfather’s money. She didn’t change much from beginning to end. She was a good character, far better than Fox, but I still felt zero connection. I don’t know what makes her tick (besides Fox’s dick) and I’m absolutely done with music as the entire personality trait. I love music but a lot of the times it’s very forced in books. It’s normally the Only Thing about the character. Oops brb gotta go make a playlist. Fox had nothing besides his past sexual conquests and how much he hated that reputation. This maybe would’ve been plausible except the fact that he kept shoving this “sex obsessed” playboy facade in Hannah’s face. Half of his interactions with Hannah were “I am SEX hear me ROAR” so that she would think all he cared about was fucking, for no apparent reason. He kept actively proving everyone else’s assumptions about him correct and it was fucking annoying I’m sorry. He did it in the past and the present. The only person he hated more than the Fox he curated was his father because according to Fox, his lusty loins were genetic. He perpetually wore a bracelet to remind himself that he’ll never be anything but his cheating father. Weird but okay (it’s actually not okay but screw it). Even then, we barely broke the surface of Fox and his glorious [read: horrible] name. I felt n o t h i n g for this man. His pity party was an absolute rager 24/7. He kept telling us how doomed and tortured and sexually promiscuous he was but we were shown zero evidence. The book tried to go in depth with stuff his mom did but so much of it was just misunderstandings and caring way too much about other people’s opinions. This comprised his entire character. It was so hard to stomach after the first hour let alone the tenth. If he would’ve had SOMETHING else going on, even a hobby, maybe then I could’ve been more tolerant. I didn’t even get the sense he liked his job. What little that was shown about his past was all told. Basically his main fuck boy years were in high school? And then he wanted to settle down with a girl in college but she was just using him. He swore off commitment because of that one relationship but he wasn’t the problem in it???? She was a shitty person but dropping out of college to “prove the point that I’m just a walking penis like my father” is a bold move. So I can see him being scared of commitment based on other people, but it was so internalized it didn’t make sense. And it continued to not make sense. He wasn’t a cheater! I have zero knowledge how his life progressed after college until we find him in the present. I don’t get it. “Dad’s legacy” is so flimsy. He is very one dimensional until his dick gets involved with Hannah and then he’s a little more 3D if you catch my drift. As for the sex, this wasn’t as hot as book one. If you can include the phrases “wet girl,” “horny girl,” “freaky girl,” and “sweet girl” you can most certainly give us a “good girl” ?????? Why was that the one we omitted here? Their attraction was instant and I felt no tension or connection. I don’t know why they love each other. One fix could’ve be to get rid of Fox’s POV to up the stakes. Then we’d really have no clue what’s going on inside his head, which is better for us all. I rather [read: vehemently] dislike Tessa’s sex scenes. I don’t like her word choices and I didn’t care for any of the scenes we got, nor the placement in relation to the plot. Some stand out verbiage:✨ “I’m where you come for the down and dirty” (sir this is a Chili’s )✨“Buns” & “buttocks” (remove the superfluous buns)✨”Split of her femininity” (I shouldn’t have to defend my dismay here)✨”Hot ass pussy” scratch the ass (lol)✨”Get up girl” yee-haw turns so fast into haw-yee. Isn’t it crazy just how fast the night changes?✨”Inside this tight thing without a rubber” repeated twice in the book (ribbed) for our pleasure. ✨”Brendan doffed his beanie” not sexual but I abhor 3/4 of this sentence. ✨”Classic Hannah” made me think of an urban dictionary entry. These characters didn’t speak naturally. To go along with all the “girl” language, I just don’t like the daddy-adjacent kink. Fox had this weird fixation on babying Hannah and treating her like a child. From treating her injuries to protecting her delicate ears from bad language, it just felt off to me. It’s just not my kink. I didn’t like Brendan spoiling Piper in book one either. Both were possessive and jealous at times they forfeited rights to be. Everyone in that town treated Hannah like a child. They were all SO worried about her dating Fox but no one, not one person, asked her opinion on the matter. She’s too innocent, too young, too this, too that. She was a whole ass adult. Miss me with that patronizing bullshit. Seeing as it was her vagina he was rawdoggin, I think she should have a chance to talk. It was WEIRD. Piper was even guilty of this and in cahoots with Brendan. Sea shanties were also here. A moose was in the epilogue. I really don’t know. I would not recommend the audiobook as the narrator sounds Very Young which contributed to the YA feels and I dislike her man voice. I also disliked hearing the dialogue of this book. I obviously don’t recommend the book in any format whatsoever. It made me hate the sound of my own name because hearing it in audiobook was horrifying. (I swear Fox is best friends with my 3rd grade best friend’s older brother because one time he told us that repeating someone’s name made them like like you so at dinner he demonstrated with my name and I SWEAR this book was deja vu.) It reminded me a lot of Duke, Actually by Jenny Holiday which I liked better than this (I actually liked the hero). Why does this book have “a novel” on the cover? A novelty maybe. Books like this drive me mad.

I KNEW I was going to love their book even more.. and here I am to report that I was correct. Hannah is everything that is good in this world, she was one of few mc’s that didn’t piss me off AT ALL, like not even once. Fox was everything I wanted him to be and more. This was the perfect friends to lovers. The way they connected through music, through their insecurities and through their friendship was amazing. Their relationship was so pure and so genuine it tugged on all my heart strings. The prologue had me cackling & swooning at the same time.

I didn’t expect Fox’s struggles since it’s not something I see often, but it was definitely interesting, especially with the parts that explored the origins of his struggles and how people over the years have fueled these struggles. Hannah also has some career challenges and also had problems connecting with some of her family members both of which a lot of people could relate to. I still liked the first book better, so it was extremely satisfying anytime Piper and Brendan appeared. I loved that the sisterly bond between Piper and Hannah still exists!!

I don't know what it is about me and second books in a series, lately, but I keep being let down by sequels of books I'd absolutelly adored.After I finished It Happened One Summer, last year, I was on a roll and I was1) totally in love with Hannah and Fox2) 90% sure and 100% thrilled they were getting their own book3) completely freaking out over the fact that I finally had another Player Boy/Nerdy Girl romance novel to match Beautiful Player that I could swoon over(fun fact: it doesn't seem intentional, but these novels have some elements in common; the age gap, the fact that Hannah -same MC name, too- is someone's blonde little sister, the player who actually is a player only because it's what people expect him to be, and so on)So, yeah, the moment this book came out, I put on hold every other book I was reading and dove into it like I was having pregnancy cravings and this book was a pool filled with fries. Unfortunately for me, the Second Book Curse, striked immediately. The prologue with all its text exchanges between Fox and Hannah was cute, but I guess it failed at showing me how their frienship evolved during the months they spent apart, only speaking through their phones. Once the chapter started rolling, the story started and they obviously were forced to share a house (because, of course, in Wesport there are no hotels and Hannah and Piper's grandma doesn't have a spare bed in her humble abode), I had to have a meeting with my own brain and heart and had to face an ugly truth I was purposely keeping myself from seeing and stop denying the evidence: this book wasn't giving.The story itself wasn't bad, although there were times I considered skimming because I was a little bored. I didn't though, because I'm an old-fashioned reader and because I kept hoping it was just a moment. Hannah's an interesting character that I wish I could have appreciated more; I had some trouble believing she was the same girl I encountered in book one. Maybe it's because this book centers on her, and she's described as this deeply insecure and nerdy, simple girl who doesn't conform to social rules despite working in the Hollywood scene, who dresses all hipster and is obsessed with music, but what I saw was a pretentious young girl who wanted it all and had it while telling herself she was oh so unlucky and oh so complicated.Fox, too, felt incredibly confusing. As I've mentioned before, his main trait is that he's a player but a player with a heart, and that he's actually keeping it up as some sort of armor he's crafted and put on by himself as a way to avoid failure by doing exactly what people expect from him. I get it, okay? I've seen it happen before. What I don't get is that he genuinely seemed to like Hannah and to wanted to be her friend in the beginning, but he kept being pushy every chance he got, to the point I started asking myself if he could get away with it if he wasn't good looking. I blame it on lust, and to whoever decided to advertize this as a friends-to-lovers as it's certainly not. The pining is there, but also not? I couldn't tell what the characters really wanted to do. One minute they were friends, the other they want to see each other naked, the next hour they were in love and then not even them could tell what was going on. I just didn't find Hannah and Fox to be that compatible, I guess. Sure, the flirtiness was there and I appreciated most of it, but they're not a couple I could see walking that very long run, if you get what I mean. Quickly elaborating, I felt like most of the relationship consisted in Hannah blabbing about albums and songs and telling Fox what he should listen to and what he should do and feel, while he diligently did all he could to show her he wanted into her pants (and in her heart, too, because of course he did) without actually putting it into proper words and trying to give her useless advice she was going to ignore anyway. Of course, they had their funny and sexy moments -some steamier and cheesier than others but who's counting-, reason why I'm giving this three and a half honest stars instead of just two. I just wished their relationship felt more balanced and that they worked better as friends before they got all the lovey dovey talks and stuff in the way. I really, really, really wanted to love this book; you guys have no idea how much I wanted to savor every line and relive the romance, hotness and chemistry that Piper and Brendan had going on.I guess you can't always be happy? At least it was quick and I got to see domestic Piper/Brendan <3I also had the chance to write down some of the songs and bands mentioned in this book (will gladly share the list with you guys if you want, just let me know) and I'm glad to announce I've found a few new favorite jams. So, yeah, consider me disappointed but also entertained. Oh, right, I almost forgot about this thing. I listened to a small sample of the audiobook yesterday and I couldn't for the life of me, listen to it without cringing at the narrator mimicking male voices. ACTUAL RATINGS 3,5/5"

Rating: ⭐⭐⭐,5Spice Meter: 🌶️🌶️,5❗This review is spoiler-free❗In all honesty, I did not have really high expectations for this book. I read a bonus scene of Fox and Hanna right before I started and I was so utterly unimpressed with it, I thought the same would apply to the book. Well...it did, but it wasn't as unbearable as I thought it would be. A lot of the dialogue and some romantic/sex scenes were incredibly cheesy and cringy, much like the first book. There was a fair amount of clichés as well, that I felt were unnecessary but other than that this book was a pretty decent read. Thankfully, a lot of it was actually enjoyable. The storyline was really interesting and there are times when clichés are actually kind of fun. This is incredibly unusual for me but I'm not really fond of Hannah as a character. Sure, she's well-rounded, compassionate, and loyal and I wholly respect that, but other than that I actually found her a bit obnoxious. Her thing with music, in particular, was irritating for most of the book. It's literally all she thought about. Music and sex with Fox. Yeah, she loves music and there's nothing wrong with that but COME OOOOOON. WE GET IIIIIT. ENOUUUUGH. I actually liked her sister more.I did actually like Fox, however. Being unwittingly made to think all he's good for is one-night stands and being judged for it really really sucks ass. I felt really bad for him and even though I don't entirely like Hannah, I think she's good for him and he deserved to be happy with her. He's also witty, smart, and compassionate, and his need to impress Hannah by any means necessary was really really cute. I might actually like him more than I did Brendan in the first book, but that's mostly because I just loooove a guy with a good sense of humour.As for their relationship, it actually turned out to be much better than what I expected, which of course made me very very happy. It was really cute and I had so much fun reading how they went from 'just friends' to 'if I lose you I'll die'. The tension and the longing were so. damn. gooood. I live for this stuff. Obviously, the spice was juuust right. Duuuh. Also, I swooned a lot over them, despite most moments being cheesy and over the top. As I already said, clichés are actually kind of fun on occasion. If I had to choose a favourite part, however, it would be the ending. It was just so beautiful in the most unexpected way. Once again, I expected something really cheesy and cliché but thankfully it was anything but 😍😍 and that epilogue...oooh that epilogue...it was so adorable.Have you read this series? What is your impression of it?"
298,9,"Hook, Line, and Sinker",Tessa Bailey,298,2023-02-03,mimi (taylor’s version),3,"I know most of you will disagree with me, and it's totally fine, but I have to take this weight off my chest: I am disappointed. Maybe it's my mood, maybe it's the fact that I have only read one book by Tessa Bailey so far so I didn't really know her range, or maybe my expectations for Fox and Hannah’s story were too high. The only thing I know with certainty is that this is not Tessa Bailey at her best.I fell in love with Fox the moment I realized he was the womanizer of It Happened One Summer, the classic bad boy who is everything but bad. Captain Frown was hot, but Fox was the one for me.And while Piper is the main lady of her life - Hannah’s words -, I’m definitely more like Hannah: the side character who helps others; everybody knows her but she isn't anybody’s first choice.It was so obvious they were meant to be a thing, and this is why I waited patiently. But one thing is character development, another is a 300 hundred pages long therapy session of everyone talking shit about one of the main character’s “problem” - including him.We get it, Fox likes sex. Shame on him for being a 30-year-old good-looking guy with a dick. He was over-sexualised for his entire life, and his father was an asshole and a cheater, and he jokes about all of that because it’s easier. But how about minding your fucking business?This is it, the whole plot: Fox getting all the ladies, Fox being horny, Fox being not horny enough, Fox not believing in himself. At first, I didn't minded; at half of the story, I was sick of it.Perhaps I should apologize for not having enjoyed it the way most of you did, but it's difficult to empathise with such a long boring piece of work. There were glimpses of the Tessa Bailey I know - the sex scenes were amazing as always and the first hundreds of pages really hooked me -, but I feel like she had all the right elements to write a love story maybe even better than the first one and she just didn't. I'm grateful for one thing tho: the epilogue. I love a good epilogue because it feels as a circle closing, and here it's definitely what it is. The right amount of information, the perfect happily ever after, the knowledge that somewhere out there love exists. And with some effort, everyone can succeed. Everyone is worthy to be loved. ↠ 3.5 stars"

I’m telling you my friends: this is the BEST ABBY JIMENEZ BOOK! Absolutely her best work! I cried and laughed so much and sometimes I did it at the same time! The book brings out so many different you buried inside and help you set them free! A workaholic, responsible ER doctor’s path crosses accidentally with a small town mayor: when her car stuck in a ditch: blame it on mischievous raccoon! Alexis: coming her ultra wealthy family who are world-renowned surgeons, differentiating her path by becoming an ER doctor. At age 37, she suffered enough from emotional, verbal, physical abuse of her ex and her own family. By a car accident, she finds herself in a small town Wakanda forever ( okay, I wrote it to check if you are still reading me!) correct name is : Wakan. Daniel: who saves Alexis from ditch, caring sweetheart and definitely dreamy book boyfriend! Yeap, he’s younger than her, mayor of town, efficient carpenter, running her grandparents’ B&B. The guy checks all the boxes! I don’t know how Abby Jimenez creates the best hero characters in her books. Each one of them are exceptional. And luckily this time Alexis is also easy to roof for with her resilience, honesty, genuineness.As long as Alexis spends her time in that small town, taking a break for her responsibilities, extra busy schedule, burdens from past, she realizes she can find the happiness at a place with a man she never imagined before. I have to admit some parts of the book truly hurt me: reading about traumatic experience Alexis has been through was really painful. I got so sad, angry, heartbroken. The angsty part was truly realistic, hard to digest!But like a sun coming out of the clouds: the sweet and promising love story of the book warmed my heart! I love this book so much! I am absolutely giving my five small town, amazingly adorable hero, second chances, emotional stars!Special thanks to NetGalley and Forever ( Grand Central Publishing) for sharing this amazing digital reviewer copy with me in exchange my honest opinions.bloginstagramfacebooktwitter"

304,10,Part of Your World,Abby Jimenez,304,2022-04-19,Regina,5,"Now THIS is the rom-com world I’ve been waiting for! Hallelujah!After a series of cynical (and not very fun) reads, what a pleasure it was to spend time with the wholehearted characters Abby Jimenez brought to life in Part of Your World. Just as I was starting to wonder if I’d outgrown the romantic comedy genre, her fourth book (but first for me) helped me realize there’s still some rom and a whole lot of com out there to be enjoyed. Part of Your World takes the opposites attract trope and gives it a good shake-up by (gasp!) making the woman almost 10 years older than the man. That’s right folks, she’s 37 and he’s 28. She’s an ER doctor at a prestigious hospital in Minneapolis, and he’s a carpenter/mayor/B&B manager at a small town called Schitt’s Creek, whoops, I mean Wakan (the Dakota word for “magic”). He wears denim, she wears Dolce & Gabbana. She comes from a family that puts the “greed” in well-pedigreed, and he comes from a self-centered teen mom. Opposites, to be sure. One thing they have in common though is obligation, and it’s those obligations that become the obstacle to their happily ever after. As they wrestle with them (and each other, ifyaknowwhatimsayin), readers are treated to many humorous lines and scenes, a baby goat in pajamas, and a pig named Kevin Bacon. Jimenez has sprinkled a little pixie dust over the story by integrating subtle nods to various fairy tales and Disney movies. Be on the lookout for Cinderella scenes and Little Mermaid moments. Also be prepared for the underlying serious theme of domestic abuse - both emotional and physical. A few of the beauties in this book have dealt with some beasts. Part of Your World might have been slightly more successful for me if it had been a tad less spicy in the s-e-x department, but that’s a personal preference and at least none of the C-words I hate so much were used. There are a few f-bombs, but that’s a-OK in my book. Or should I say world? ;)4.5 starsMy heartfelt thanks to the author and Estelle at Forever for the gifted copy to review.

305,10,Part of Your World,Abby Jimenez,305,2022-04-30,jessica,4,"the crazy high average rating is definitely what drew me to this book. my experiences with AJs novels have been so-so, but a book that currently has a 4.62 rating has to be better than just mediocre, right?and luckily this is!the relationship between alexis and daniel is super sweet. yes, it starts off with a massive case of insta-lust, but i think the story progresses in a really nice way that shows how genuine feelings develop between the two of them. it feels real. dont get me wrong, the story is super predictable, but its honest, so i liked that. my only complaint would be the balance between the fun, cute, and lightheartedness of a rom-com and the serious, heavy topics of real life. i think romance books incorporating more of the serious topics of relationships is a good thing, but sometimes i pick up a romance to escape real life, and i thought this story had a bit too much seriousness and prevented that escapism at times.but honestly, it wasnt a deal breaker. i had fun and thought this was an improvement from my previous experiences with AJs books!↠ 3.5 stars"
306,10,Part of Your World,Abby Jimenez,306,2022-05-06,Kezia Duah,5,"“Grace costs you nothing.”Hey, so this was definitely giving a bit of “insta love,” but it’s okay because there was so much more to this book than just the romance.Alexis Montgomery comes from a long line of world-renowned surgeons. She and her twin brother are expected to carry on this legacy, except maybe they don’t want to do it exactly in the way their family members did. As she was headed somewhere, because I really don’t remember where she was going, her car ended up having a problem. Luckily for her, Daniel shows up and helps her. Daniel comes from a local town, where he rents out a family house to visitors. They probably didn’t expect to see each other again, but as fate would have it, they see each other again, and “things” happen. How does their relationship develop from there? I thought this one was really amazing. I wholeheartedly could not put it down and finished it on the same day I started. Let’s start with the romance. Alexis and Daniel were really really really cute. Like I said from the beginning, it was definitely giving insta love but they still developed their relationship over the course of the book. Alexis and Daniel live different lives in regards to money, so it was really nice to see how they learned from each other through tasks and conversations. “Don’t let them decide the life you’re going to live.”A huge part of this book was abuse, both physical and emotional. Jimenez does a great job of highlighting how emotional abuse is just as powerful as physical abuse. I want to especially give a high five for revealing that these kinds of abuse can be among family members. My heart hurt for Alexis so much throughout the book. Except for her twin brother, best friend, and Daniel, I literally hated everyone she was surrounded with. How could someone survive with that much toxic energy? It was very realistic to portray this struggle that she had and how she slowly overcame them one at a time. How does she do this? Of course, Daniel also has his own individual struggles, not abuse, but more on the financial side. I was scared that we weren’t going to see any struggles on Daniel’s side, but we did, even though it felt at times that Alexis' problems were shown more. Daniel is pretty much another illustration of fictional men being amazing. I could smell husband material from the first lines about him. He’s 10 years younger than Alexis, and she made this a pretty big deal. I thought we are in a time when age isn’t a huge deal, but apparently, not everyone thinks this way.Overall, there were some funny lines here and there, and the pacing was great. It wasn’t really smutty though, which I was kinda surprised by. I’m also surprised that I’m surprised since it’s not like the rest of her books were that smutty. I believe Jimenez has written four books so far, all of which I’ve read. Her characters have so much chemistry. It is something she has definitely mastered. I personally think this is her best one yet!! "

308,10,Part of Your World,Abby Jimenez,308,2022-04-19,Jayme,4,"It’s no secret that Abby Jimenez writes some of my favorite Romance books….Although I only read a few a year, you can BET that one of them will always be whatever Abby has published! I am always so excited when I see that she has a new book available to request.Sure, this genre has a formula that leads to happily ever after-but that doesn’t mean it’s easy to write. In romance you MUST like the characters, you MUST enjoy their dialogue, and you MUST feel the chemistry!! 🔥In addition, you absolutely MUST feel the angst! Theirs and yours-as you become worried that one of the leads will let the other get away, causing you to scream at that character to “go get your person”! NOW!! All the boxes are checked here! And, once again, Abby Jimenez adds an “extra layer” to her stories by weaving another important topic into a sub-plot-this time, “domestic violence-both verbal and physical abuse“, providing resources after the epilogue.This story introduces us Alexis Montgomery, who has been tapped to carry on her family legacy of world-renowned surgeons. (Think Meredith Grey of Grey’s Anatomy) She and her brother, Derek, have been groomed since childhood to be the next generation to lead their prestigious hospital into the next century and then Derek bails out. Not their first choice, but nonetheless, now their only choice, their parents want Alexis to marry the right man-Neil-the head of surgery-have the right friends-the horrible Jessica and Gabby, and fulfill her destiny-Despite the fact that she has she realized that she doesn’t want any of these things. Late one night, she is driving home from an out of town funeral, and she has to swerve to avoid hitting a raccoon-ending up in a ditch. Daniel Grant, a very tattooed, blue color, (and younger) man, offers to tow her out, and afterward she runs into him again at a nearby bar -which is the only place in town that is open this late with available food and rest rooms. She decides to help him win a bet against his friends as a way to “thank him” for his assistance. Despite the fact that their lives are as different as night and day, their sizzling chemistry is undeniable, and will make Alexis question if money does buy happiness and if if she has the courage to live life on her own terms. As she tries to reconcile how she feels, we hear from both Alexis and Daniel, in alternating chapters, and I enjoyed hearing from them both equally. Thankfully, Alexis has one true friend in her corner, Bri, and we should ALL have a friend like her-a friend who will tell you what you NEED to hear, and CHEER YOU ON, as you go for what will make you happy! If you have enjoyed this author’s past work-you will enjoy this book too! AVAILABLE NOW!!One last thing—I was excited to learn that in 2023, it will be Bri’s turn in the spotlight and it will be her chance to find happiness! ❤️ My calendar is already marked!! Thank You to Forever for my gifted copy! It was my pleasure to offer a candid review!"
309,10,Part of Your World,Abby Jimenez,309,2022-06-03,Kay ☼,5,"Part of Your World is out of this world!😍💥‼️It's easily my favorite rom-com so far this year. I wish I had more stars to give! In the middle of nowhere between Cedar Rapids and Minneapolis, Alexis avoids a raccoon on the road and ends up in a ditch. Luckily, a handsome Daniel drove by and helps tow her Mercedes out. This isn't instant love, but close. Their encounter on the road sets off an unlikely romance between two people who are polar opposites, but their chemistry is off the charts! I soo love them together.Daniel Grant is a carpenter, and mayor, and runs a B & B in the tiny town of Wakan, MN. Dr. Alexis Montgomery is an ER doctor from the big city. I love their flirty connection, witty banter, and laugh-out-loud humor. I love the animals, Daniel's circle of friends, and dialogues with some risqué. 🤭There's a scene that I listened to THREE times because it was immensely hilarious. On a slightly serious part, there's an underlying emotional abuse message in the story. Part of Your World hits all the right notes and gives me huge satisfaction~adding to my favorite shelf (the first rom-com!). The romance is hot ~ 3/5 🔥 scale.🎧💓Is it normal to have a voice crush? If so Zachary Webber is mine!"

Abby Jimenez never disappoints. I’ve read every book she’s written and I’ve loved them all. Part of Your World is one of her best. I loved so much about this story and these characters. I mean, Daniel! Could she have written a more perfect hero? I think not. Alexis is not having a good day when she swerves to miss an animal and ends up in a ditch. Two hours away from home. She’s waiting for a tow when a young guy in a truck pulls up to assist her. His name is Daniel and he’s about ten years younger than her. He’s kind, refreshing, and all kinds of wonderful. Once they spend a night together, they can’t stay away from each other. Talk about totally different worlds though. The life Alexis leads as a thirty seven year old successful ER physician compared to Daniel’s small town life of running his family’s business and doing some carpenter/mayor work on the side couldn’t be less alike but that doesn’t seem to matter. These two are compatible in all the ways that count and Alexis has never been treated so well in her entire life. Of course I loved the romance of this story. It was so lovely and the banter was great. I laughed more than once. There is also some emotion, a bit of angst, and it touches on some sensitive subject matter Abuse- physical and mental/emotional. We’ve already established that Daniel was perfect and Alexis was great as well- her growth was a joy to watch. I loved so many of the side characters and I especially loved the small town Daniel was from. It felt truly magical. Almost like it was it’s own character. It had a great ‘found family’ aspect as well. 

Because sometimes family isn’t what you’re born into. Sometimes family is found.

Part of Your World gave me that same THIS IS GOING TO BE A FAVORITE feel as ‘The Friend-Zone” did and I’m sure it’s going to be on my favorites list in 2022. This one is a must read romance I highly recommend![""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>"

313,10,Part of Your World,Abby Jimenez,313,2023-01-22,Nenia ✨ I yeet my books back and forth ✨ Campbell,4,"

Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestIt's so hard for me to find contemporary romances I actually enjoy because so many of them end up feeling really bland to me because they lack emotional stakes and conflict. I need some kind of driving force involving external conflict or inner turmoil to keep me turning pages, and that seems to be something that more and more authors are afraid to include these days. Maybe that's because, these days, any semi-flawed or unlikable character or situation involving any kind of nuance ends up getting you cancelled on TikTok.PART OF YOUR WORLD, however, is that one book in one hundred that actually manages to write a successful rom-com that doesn't feel patronizing, unrealistic, or-- worse-- pandering. It includes so many of my favorite tropes that it felt like it was written for me: small town vibes, reverse age gap, class differences, STEM heroine (she's a doctor!), cute animals, strong female friendships, and loads and loads of family d(tr)auma to unpack and dread and scream over.Alexis meets Daniel when her car gets stuck in a ditch. He helps tow her and then they meet again when she stops at the local bar for a bite. They end up hitting it off but she's a little put off by how young he is, and how their lives are totally different. (Read: she's loaded.) But they end up deciding to be a sort of exclusive-friends-with-benefits thing, which I wouldn't have minded if ALL THE SEX SCENES WEREN'T FADE TO BLACK (rude), but obviously they both catch feelings and obviously, both of them have extenuating factors that come into conflict with their budding romance. Daniel is about to lose his family house because his drug-addicted mother owns it and she wants to sell it all to run off with some guy. And Alexis is being put under incredible pressure by her manipulative and uptight family and her emotionally abusive ex.The conflict drives the story and keeps up the tension, adding edge to what would otherwise be a pretty sugary-sweet insta-love romance wish fulfillment fantasy. Not that there's anything wrong with that. While I was composing my review in my head, I was actually going to talk about how *some* fluffy books manage to sell that fantasy without being too annoying. But then all that other stuff in the book came into play and I ended up being even more impressed than I already was. I only really have three complaints: (1) if you're going to tell me this dude is the Alexander the Great of having sex, you have to give us SOMETHING. Otherwise it feels like a taunt. (2) It kind of felt like the whole thing with Daniel's mom was just kind of resolved off-page, which was weird, because it felt like the book was playing her up to do something awful. (3) Could have done with 90% fewer Princess Bride references.But overall, this was a lovely book. Just as good as the last book by this author that I read and thank goodness I have two more of hers on Kindle to read. PLUS, the next book in this series is going to be about Bri and she is absolutely the coolest and I can't wait for her story.Thanks to FLINN and Anniek for reading this with me! Make sure to check out their reviews! :)4 stars"

315,10,Part of Your World,Abby Jimenez,315,2022-06-17,Kaceey,5,"This book should be Part of Your World too!Alexis has grown up with the family legacy draped over her. Her super-successful, ultra-wealthy family have expectations for her she can’t possibly meet. Being an ER doctor is not enough. (Seriously?) No, they expect her to be a surgeon, eventually taking over for her parents, soon to retire. But guess what folks…that’s not the life she wants.Enter Daniel, who lives an Andy Griffith-like simple life, in a small town where everyone knows each other and all your business!🤣. He also happens to be the town mayor while also running his family’s B&B.When Alexis’ car breaks down, it’s Daniel to the rescue after coming across her on the side of the road. And in less time than it takes to change a tire, sparks start to fly! But how can this conceivably work? Right!?💁🏻‍♀️. Daniel is a small town guy, much younger. His social circles aren’t exactly in the rarified air of Alexis’ high-brow friends.As always Abby Jimenez gives us real, true characters with real life problems that everyone can connect to on some level. I loved the connection between these two characters as they struggled with their own issues of family, expectations and pressures.The narrators did a superb job and I was locked-in from start to finish!

316,10,Part of Your World,Abby Jimenez,316,2023-03-05,Ingrid,5,"You know when you love a book so much you don’t know where to start when explaining and recommending it? That’s how I feel as I attempt to write this.As magical and wonderful as this read was, it does contain some heavy topics that, although I believe the author treated with great care, could be triggering to some. These are: abusive parents, emotional and physical domestic abuse, peer pressure, and depression. I apologize if I’m forgetting any others, but I do think these are the most tackled in the story.The connection between our two main characters is one of the best I’ve read to date! Alexis and Daniel are one of the best examples of what a healthy relationship is supposed to be like and it felt very close to reality on numerous scenes.But it wasn’t just them I adored: it was also the entirety of the small town of Walkon. Some of our secondary characters are Liz, Doug, Brian, and Bri (if I misspelled any please don’t judge, I listened to the audiobook) AND CAN I JUST ADOPT THEM ALL? Their personalities were absolutely amazing and fun to get to know!I just want to give Alexis and Liz an eternity of hugs. These marvelous women deserve the sun, the clouds, the stars, and the whole moon. They might not be real, but they’re real to me. 🥺🫶Also, Doug: I EXPECT A BOOK ABOUT HIM. If there never is, I will quietly sob away into a little corner until I become all wrinkly and wise.Anywho, my point is: if you took the trigger warnings under consideration and believe you won’t be triggered, PLEASE READ THIS. You won’t regret it!"
317,10,Part of Your World,Abby Jimenez,317,2022-04-11,Debra ,5,"Alexis Montgomery is a sophisticated city girl who comes from a long line of Montgomery doctors. She is carrying around a lot of expectations on her shoulders. Her father is overbearing, her mother goes along and her ex-boyfriend just won’t leave. Then she meets Mega hot carpenter and bed and breakfast and yes, because he doesn't have enough to do mayor as well. She's 37 he is 28 and both are hot-to-trot.But can they be part of each other's world. Yes, we have seen these tropes before. Older woman younger man, opposites attract. etc. and yet this one had a little magic to it. I enjoyed each character and their witty banter. They had major chemistry and things going on in their own lives. Yet, they were perfect for each other.I loved hearing/reading their individual voices in their own chapters. This worked nicely in the audiobook and really added to my enjoyment of the book. This was a great audiobook, and I thought the narrators did a great job. I also loved the dose of overbearing and stuck-in-his-ways father. He was almost a caricature of ridiculousness. These characters are dealing with real issues and their own personal goals. There are also strong supporting characters, a loveable pooch, and some drama through in. I love how she captured the small-town-everyone-know-everybody vibe.At times, I wanted to yell at Alexis “it’s your life to live – live it lady” Plus, she throws in some medical emergencies and a character dealing with domestic violence as well.In case you haven't figured it out...I Loved this book!!! I think you will as well!This is my first book by Abby Jimenez, and I am kicking myself that I have not read her books sooner! I will be reading her books from now on!!!Thank you to Hachette Audio, Forever and NetGalley who provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

318,10,Part of Your World,Abby Jimenez,318,2022-04-05,Ceecee,4,"Alexis Montgomery is driving back home from her great aunt’s funeral when a raccoon dices with death by wheels, she swerves and it forces her into a ditch. Don’t fret, rescue is on hand, enter Daniel Carpenter, who thinks she is well out of his league. However, he’s cute, in fact he’s smokin’ and how can you resist a man who fosters a baby… goat! Alexis is not from his world, she is an ER doctor in Minneapolis from an eminent wealthy medical family and there is the 10 year age gap to consider, and yet, and yet… She’s only got one life to live.This isn’t just a romcom, this is Abby Jimenez style. Yes you get rom (and it’s pretty steamy in places, well Daniel is smoking’) and plenty of com (usually Hunter, the adorable dog) but you also get issues. In this case it’s mental abuse and domestic violence which the author handles well and yet you feel the characters pain . The author clearly demonstrates that this can happen to anyone. The author also shows via Alexis the difficulties and inequities in medical provision, would there were more solutions like those offered here.I love that this is basically a modern day of fairytale, there are excellent nods to both Cinderella and The Little Mermaid which are cleverly done. Much of the Magic comes courtesy of Waken (it means magic) which is where Daniel lives. Outsiders may see this place as Nowheresville, in fact it is most definitely Somewheresville with its own brand of a special sprinkling of fairy dust. It’s a ‘character’ in its own right. I’d like to live there, in Daniel‘s house, preferably with Daniel who is the most fabulous character. However for me, Hunter steals the show with one scene which has me howling with laughter!! The chemistry between Daniel and Alexis is hot, it feels right but Alexis has a lot to learn about real worlds and to gain the strength from that knowledge. Her family are something else, as for her ex, surgeon Neil, George Clooney in ER as Doug Ross he most certainly isn’t. The ending is maybe a bit of a turnaround and possibly saccharine but that’s not to say it’s not enjoyable and it is what you hope for! Overall, if you like an intelligent well written romcom then look no further than Abby Jimenez. She has a way of hooking you into the storylines and keeping you glued.With thanks to NetGalley and especially to Little Brown Book Group for the much appreciated arc in return for an honest review."
319,10,Part of Your World,Abby Jimenez,319,2022-11-16,Rachel Reads Ravenously,5,"When her car breaks down in the middle of nowhere, Alexis gets a tow from an unexpected and handsome stranger. Flash to the next day and she’s fleeing his house after a one-night stand. But Daniel has gotten under her skin and Alexis goes back for me. The problem is, the two of them live in very different worlds and Alexis doesn’t know how Daniel would fit in hers. I ended up loving this book and I did not expect to. I listened to the audiobook on the recommendation of a friend (thank you, Christy!) and I was really very hesitant to pick this one up because I actually hated The Friend Zone. It has two incredible narrators (Julia Whelan and Zachary Webber) and they really brought this story to life for me.I really loved the relationship between Alexis and Daniel and how it developed. It was the story of two unlikely people who found something beautiful. And although I loved them, I was frustrated at times reading the book because I just wanted to shake Alexis and her choices. I understood why she made them, but the plot point of her being almost “ashamed” of Daniel and his life just seemed so elitist of her. I get that it was her background I just wanted her to wake up sooner.Also I loved the little things the author threw in from her regular life. It was obvious the dog in the book was based off of the one she posts on tik tok. The author also owns a cupcake chain called Nadia Cakes (which are delicious, I’ve had them) and she references them in the book. That combined with a wonderful sense of humor just really made this book come together for me as whole and I am glad I gave this author a second chance."
320,10,Part of Your World,Abby Jimenez,320,2022-05-05,Larissa Cambusano,4,"4.25 ⭐️ I didn’t expect to love this as much as I did??? it was so much deeper than I thought it would be but yet so fun & cute & fluffy. it gave me fairy tale vibes!!!! I chuckled & I teared up.. all the emotions were felt by me. Alexis was so strong and amazing. now listen… she annoyed me sometimes but I still loved her 🤭 AND DANIEL, mr. mf perfect wow??All of the side characters were also incredible & added so much to this book. Doug & Liz & Bryan!!! loved them so much. But the real star for me was ✨Bree✨ I need a book for her immediately, I require it. “sometimes family isn’t what you’re born into, sometimes family is found. and I found mine in him.” "
321,10,Part of Your World,Abby Jimenez,321,2022-05-08,Kelsi,5,"I’m just so sad that I finished this so quick, and that I can’t read it again for the first time "
322,10,Part of Your World,Abby Jimenez,322,2022-11-21,Júlia,4,"This writing was SO SMOOTH!    This was one of the goodreads choice awards nominees I hadn't read yet, so I decided to pick it up. I didn't agree with every choice they made for this year's nominees, most of them were just based on hype. However, not every choice was a bad one, and Part of Your World deserved the spot it got.  This is a closed-door/fade-to-black romance, which makes it an AMAZING romance book for you to recommend to your grandma and co-workers without embarrassing yourself.    The writing flows so well, the pacing is fantastic, both main characters have the most lovely little brains and their POV's are adorable.  This is: rich city girl (who's a doctor), falls in love with small-town lumberjack and I honestly had the most amazing time with it.  The only reason I couldn't give it five stars, was because I really do think this could have benefited from some spice.  It's not like I can't enjoy a book if it doesn't have any spice, but I felt robbed of it here. They were so amazing together and their overall chemistry was so great, even if it was a slow burn, I wish we had gotten at LEAST ONE scene.  Anyways, still a great time."
323,10,Part of Your World,Abby Jimenez,323,2022-06-21,Sheyla ✎,5,"Abby Jimenez is a must-read romance author for me. I've enjoyed all of her books and Part of Your World is my new favorite.We meet our heroine Alexis Montgomery when she is coming back from a funeral. Her car lands in a ditch when she swerves to avoid hitting a raccoon. She is waiting for a tow truck and is talking on her phone with her best friend Bri when a car stops and a guy comes over to check on her and helps her pull her car out. The guy, Daniel, is efficient and soon, her Mercedes is out. They meet again at the small-town bar where everyone seems to know each other. Daniel warns her that their friends have a wager to see who will take her home. In turn, Alexis asked Daniel to walk her out, so he can win the bet and she can leave. Daniel always a gentleman offers to cook her a grilled cheese before she leaves and she agrees to go home with him. What happens next, you can guess. What is different is the obstacles they have to surpass in order to be together.Alexis is in her late thirties. She is an ER physician who comes from a rich family. Her parents and her brother Derek are renowned surgeons and being a Montgomery is almost a synonym for royalty. There is a huge expectation for her to be better now that her brother decided to stay in Cambodia after marrying in secret. Alexis is not crazy about the responsibility of being a Montgomery. She never wanted to be the one who carried the torch but with Derek leaving, she has no choice. To make matter worse, her parents would prefer for her to go back with Neil, her ex, who is the chief of Surgery. Alexis left him because he was emotionally abusive and he cheated on her. Her parents don't care, they think the world of Neil.Daniel Grant also has his own family legacy. His family has lived in Wakan and has helped the town for over 125 years. Daniel wears multiple hats. He runs his grandparents' home as a B&B, he is the town mayor and he is a carpenter. He is also a great cook, a good friend, and overall just a good person. He has a dog and is taking care of a baby goat who wears adorable pajamas (at least in my mind they were adorable). Daniel has tattoos, wears denim and flannel, drives a truck, and is also ten years younger than Alexis.How can they be together? Their world is completely opposite and incompatible but their chemistry is not.I love everything about this book. I love Wakan, the dog, the pig (Kevin Bacon), the baby goat, the magic, Daniel, Bri, and the narrators. Any book read by Julia Whelan becomes an instant favorite of mine. Zachary Webber does an amazing job in bringing Daniel to life. I thought both of them complemented each other well.Kudos to Abby Jiminez for writing a romance novel that works!!Cliffhanger: No5/5 FangsA complimentary copy was provided by Forever via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.MrsLeif's Two Fangs About It | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram"
324,10,Part of Your World,Abby Jimenez,324,2022-11-16,Logan,5,"oh man this book was SO good. i don’t think any other fictional man has ever set the bar as high as daniel grant.after a rogue raccoon leaves her crashed in a ditch, Alexis Montgomery finds herself face to face with the charming Daniel Grant. a towed car, a fake bet, and a fancy grilled cheese later, the two end up spending much more time together than anticipated.this was just such a sweet and heartwarming yet hilarious story. a wealthy doctor + a small town carpenter, this is definitely an opposites attract story. Alexis has such a personal journey in this book, breaking away from the box she has always been put in because of her family, overcoming the damage her ex-husband’s abuse caused. and all the while, Daniel patiently waits for her with hearts in his eyes like he can’t believe his luck. it is sickeningly cute and I could not recommend this book more!"
325,10,Part of Your World,Abby Jimenez,325,2022-11-14,Jessica ,5,"Wow, I'm actually obsessed with this book!? Alexis gets stranded in a small town and is saved by Daniel. While she's a city girl and he's a small town guy, who happens to be a bit younger than her, the two find themselves spending an incredible night together. But Alexis leaves and thinks that's it. But Alexis finds herself returning and loving herself when she's with Daniel. But she's a successful doctor who shouldn't want to be with someone like Daniel. THE ANGST IN THIS BOOK!? I loved how Alexis didn't want to leave the more and more she would visit Daniel and how she loved the life she was living compared to the toxic life she was living in the city. There were points where I was getting frustrated with Alexis for letting other people come before her and dictate her life, but that's just reality and definitely relatable. And I LOVED Daniel and how hard he fell for Alexis. He was just a regular guy and he just wanted to make her happy. This book took me by surprise and I'm so happy I read it! It's definitely a new favorite!"

329,10,Part of Your World,Abby Jimenez,329,2022-08-09,Corina,3,"ALMOST FOUR STARSThere are so many things to enjoy about this book, but most of all baby goats in pyjamas!!!!!Part of Your World is an opposite attract, age gap romance where two very different worlds collide.I’m not usually a fan of age gap, but I thought the author managed it well. Because in the end the almost 10 year difference between the couple didn’t feel like a hurdle. Alexis is a successful city ER physician, and Daniel a skilled carpenter from a small town. It doesn’t sound like a relationship between those two should work, but Daniel gets Alexis in such a way that small town suddenly feels more like home than Alexis’s actual home. And I loved that for her!!!I also loved it when Daniel and Alexis were together, it felt just RIGHT. They clicked in an effortless way. And rooting for them was a no brainier.The outside, like friends and family was what made everything so messy.As expected the author tackles a heavy topic in a realistic and sensitive manner – this time it’s domestic violence. I felt the author, as always, did a great job making it work, by blending such an emotional matter in a way that worked and fit the overall storyline!And last but not least, a wonderful surprise – there were some magical elements that were unexpected but not unwelcome!!!Overall the book felt solid from the writing to the characters. And it’s a book I finished easily in one sitting, I actually finish all her books in one sitting. The only issue I have with all of her books is that I never remember much about them when I’m done. Which is really sad, because there is nothing wrong about any of her novels. They are just not that memorable to me.Nevertheless, her books need to be on everyone’s romance list. And you can be assured that I’ll be reading her next one, which will apparently be about Alexis’s best friend Bri.

330,11,You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty,Akwaeke Emezi,330,2022-11-23,emma,2,"i can tolerate a lot of things in books, but i cannot tolerate NONSENSE. people would never act like this! and if they do, don't tell me! ignorance really is bliss and i would rather live in what is apparently a fantasy world where people are normal and no one is this insane.for example.if the girl i was kind of dating screwed my dad and i found out from my dad's friend, and then i went to look for the gf so we could talk and she grabbed my head, dug her nails in, screamed into my face, and shoved me, i would not APOLOGIZE. i would be arrested for the federal crime i'd immediately commit.anyway this is a romance between a girl and her boyfriend's dad.i loved the beginning of this book, and i'll keep trying this author because i love their style, but this romance...EW. not even just for the setup (which is a lot but not insurmountable), but these characters, and their weird bogus compliments, and their instalove, and...bleh. the father picks a girl half his age he just met over his kids (one of whom was, again, in love with her at the time their relationship was consummated).so i'm on team The Kids. which made this book not go very well.also it's repetitive.and you don't dice an onion to caramelize it.bottom line: unhinged!2.5---------------------tbr reviewi wish every book had a title that was like a long compliment(thanks to netgalley for the e-arc)"

332,11,You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty,Akwaeke Emezi,332,2022-02-21,Alexis Hall,None,"Source of book: NetGalley (thank you)Relevant disclaimers: nonePlease note: This review may not be reproduced or quoted, in whole or in part, without explicit consent from the author.Before I get into this, can we just touch upon the whole being allowed to use a Florence + The Machine lyric as the title of your book thing? Hashtag author goals. Also I understand, like, localisation is a thing and, ironically, I know less about the British market than the US market but, like, why do Americans get this gorgeous vivid cover with a person’s actual face on it? And we get something that looks like the fucking relic ring from Skyrim.Like, did they think we wouldn’t buy a book with a picture of beautiful Black woman on the front? So she had to be represented by a severed hand instead? What even? Is this reflecting badly on the UK reading audience or the UK publisher? I can’t even tell. Anyway, this book is gorgeous, and I am dizzy on how much I loved it. I understand it’s the author’s first foray into romance and, obviously, when mainstream publications speak of romance it’s hard to figure out whether they mean, a book that happens to have a relationship in it, never mind whatever else it’s about, a book that wants to tell the romance genre (from a position of ignorance) all the ways it’s wrong or unrealistic or fomulaeic, or a book that is a sincere engagement with the romance genre while bringing a slightly different perspective. For my money, and your mileage may vary, You Made A fool of Death With Your Beauty is the latter.It's a deliberately literary take on the genre, of course, but—to mind—it also treats genre expectations respectfully and with awareness. Which is to say, this while, in genre-terms, this is definitely a heroine-focused romance (it is thoroughly Feyi’s journey), there’s a strong central romance, and a happy ending, that is either 'for now' or 'for ever' depending on your personal perspective. Not everything is wrapped up in a neat little bow—these are complicated people and the situation is complicated—but I’m not of the school of thought that believes a romantic happy ending requires not just personal happiness but complete social integration of that happiness. As I’ve said on my occasions, that’s always struck me as a profoundly normative and privileged point of view. Of course it’s fine to create a mini utopia if that’s what feels right for an individual text. But the idea that’s a requirement? Or the happy ending isn’t happy enough? Please.I’m aware I’m kind of talking around this book a fair bit here and it’s not just that I love the sound of my own voice (my own voice typing). I’m kind of anticipating—fairly or unfairly—that this book might be polarising for some people, and that there’s always an understandable resistance towards someone coming into the genre from outside or being placed adjacent to the genre by the outside, so I’m concerned that my praise could come across as diminishing of the genre itself. But I do genuinely believe the way this book—with the way it centralises Blackness and queerness, with the freedom it permits its heroine to live her life as she needs to and never punishes her for it, with all its beauty and its pain—carefully challenges some of the invisible boundaries we set upon the genre from the inside is … honestly, I think it’s important. And, while it is not up to me to make this judgement, I read it as coming from a brave and loving and generous place. Please don’t think I’m trying to claim this lit-ficcy romance is the magic answer to the genre, or the thing the genre has always needed, or, like, a fix for the way the genre can be problematic and limiting. The genre will someday have to figure that shit out for itself. But in the meantime, this book is *lovely*. It’s as bold and entrancing and complex as its heroine. And I hope it will be welcomed.The basic deal here is that the heroine, Feyi, is an artist whose husband died five years ago in a terrible car crash. Needing to live a completely different life in the aftermath of such terrible grief, she’s moved from the claustrophobia of her small town to New York to pursue her career and bond with her best friend, Joy—a self-destructive lesbian with a penchant for married women. Feyi has not exactly felt like dating since her husband died but while she’s out at a party she has a brief, physical encounter with a stranger called Milan. She and Milan continue to have a few mutually beneficial respectful but emotion-free hook-ups until one of Milan’s friends, Nasir, towards whom Feyi experiences something of a pull, approaches her. She’s still not ready for anything resembling a relationship but Nasir, who makes it very clear he is into Feyi, is willing to take things slow. To be friend with the hope of more in the future. It’s at this point that Nasir brings an opportunity to Feyi. His father is on the board of directors for a museum about to open an exhibition of Black Diaspora artists and one of the artists has pulled out. Nasir had encouraged his father to put Feyi’s work before the curator and the curator had loved it. Nasir’s father, it turns out, is a big deal, being rich, influential and a celebrity chef (albeit a somewhat reclusive one). You can probably see where this might be going: Nasir invites Feyi to stay with him and his father in his father’s gorgeous tropical-island home while she prepares her installation for the art show. And from the moment Feyi meets the widowed, charismatic Alim Blake she’s conscious of her an emotional and physical attraction that feels realer than anything she’s experienced since Jonah died. An attraction she also knows she should in no way act upon. Okay so. That’s a lot. I’m aware that it’s a lot. And I suspect if you told me the premise of this book in isolation, I’d be like “heh, no thank you.” I think the combination of the age-gap (there’s nineteen years between them), the fact Feyi is not-quite-dating Alim’s actual son, plus the inherent power dynamics in the relationship, given she’s a young woman trying to make it as an artist, and he’s a man who has already established himself in the world to the point of owning one of the most amazing houses I think I have ever read about fiction. But, you know what? Fuck it. This really worked for me, on pretty much every level. Sometimes when I have to describe romance to romance sceptics which, admittedly, doesn’t come up very often because I don’t leave the house or have any friends but when I do, I often call it a genre of polemic. Because essentially a romance novel is … an argument, I mean in the classical rhetorical sense, not in the sense of a fight. A romance novel essentially presents an argument—makes a case—as to why two (or more) people would have their lives significantly improved by sharing them. And if you come out of the book agreeing then that’s a successful romance. If you come out of the book feeling meh or, worse, then it’s not. And obviously this is hugely subjective: what you read as protective alpha caring for his partner I might read as an abusive dick upholding the patriarchy, what I might read as two flawed human beings fitting their broken pieces together, you might read as two dumpster fires who need therapy not a relationship. For me, You Made A fool of Death With Your Beauty makes its case beautifully and sufficiently convincingly that Feyi and Alim working through the various (very real) obstacles to their being together in order to be together felt genuinely romantic. Even triumphant. Because, what can I say? Sometimes you’re just going to fall for your boyfriend’s dad, y’know? I mean, I’ve just expressed that in a deliberately frivolous fashion but it’s something the book takes a lot of care with. For starters, Feyi and Nasir aren’t actually dating at the point she meets Alim—and she is already beginning to recognise she doesn’t feel about Nasir the way he feels about her—and the complications (I hesitate to say ‘taboo’ because it’s not really a taboo, just … socially discouraged) inherent to a relationship between Feyi and Alim are never presented as titillating. This isn’t a guilty fantasy of falling for a person you shouldn’t want. It’s a story of two people who truly belong together choosing each other because their love means more to them than convention and potential condemnation.It's this—as much as Feyi and Alim both being bisexual—that You Made A fool of Death With Your Beauty so successful as a queer m/f romance. It’s a book that understands, on a fundamental level, that choosing love is sometimes one of the boldest, most defiant things you can do.Even putting aside the potentially challenging nature of its central relationship, I think it’s pretty clear from the summary alone that there are several ways in which the narrative pushes against some of the invisible boundaries of romance that I mentioned earlier. And I don’t mean in terms of the HEA or anything like, I mean in terms of the unspoken no-nos governing characters and relationships that we pretend aren't dictated by the most heteronormative of expectations. For example, I can’t actually remember the last time I read a romance (outside of erotic romance) where the heroine is allowed to explore romantic-adjacent relationships with multiple men and this is presented as neutral-to-positive by the text itself. Feyi’s relationship with Nasir is, of course, difficult because he is accepting friendship as a substitute for what he really wants (although, let’s very clear, this is his choice, and Feyi is not responsible for him) but I really appreciated her interactions with Milan—the man she fucks in a bathroom in the opening chapter. It’s undeniable, of course, that Feyi is behaving recklessly (she convinces him, for example, not to wear a condom) —and a little selfishly in the sense that she is having sex with Milan not for pleasure, exactly, but to reclaim her body from grief. But there’s never a moment when Feyi’s agency in the situation or her consent isn’t absolutely central and absolutely respected, both by Milan and by the text itself. There are no consequences for Feyi for her choices here, be they emotional, physical or social. And while both characters are mildly irresponsible, there is never a sense of danger for Feyi in what she is doing. The text takes it for granted that Milan—a cis man—will have sex with a woman he’s just met in a bathroom and not in any way view that as invitation to behave badly or judge her: this may, unfortunately, feel too much like romantic fantasy for some but I personally (and with no standing to judge) appreciated it. It felt like a deliberate attempt to push back against the dominant cultural narrative that casual sex is inherently or inevitably dangerous to women. And while that may, in fact, be true, it’s not a natural dynamic that we should replicate unthinkingly in the stories we tell. It’s an aberrant situation created by rape culture and the patriarchy. When the reality is and should be: women can have casual sex, even reckless selfish casual sex, without being punished for it. Err, to bring this slightly closer to my lane because, obviously, I’m way out of it right now: I know depicting safe, responsible sex is sort of seen as ethically appropriate in fiction and I’m not knocking that, but I think it’s easy to inadvertently cross the line into reinforcing oppressive ideas about sex, and sex among people of marginalised identity in particular. I could talk about this more with reference to my own identity but I’d rather talk about this book.Because, oh God, I’ve written so much without even touching on even half the things that are amazing about it. There’s Feyi, who I simply adored: she’s obviously still trying to figure out how to survive her loss, but she’s also just incredibly funny and full of life, allowed by the text to be confident, about her art, about her own beauty, as well as human and uncertain. She doesn’t always make the best choices but why should she? She’s a person, not a paragon. There’s also Feyi’s relationship with Joy: honestly, if the whole story had been them bantering and taking the piss (very lovingly) out of each other, I wouldn’t have minded. And then there’s the way the book both celebrates love (all kinds of love, not just the romantic relationships at it centre) and deals with the grief, particularly with how we live with grief and the way it changes us. But also the way that grief and love, at some point, are simply expressions of each other. Perhaps even reflections of each other. One of the things that moved me very much was the way, as the story unfolded itself, it presented a concept of grief not as something isolating, or something that separates you and your pain from the rest of the world, but as something universal and potentially uniting. There are many human experiences, after all, which are specific: but at some point we will all lose someone we love and have to live with that loss.As for the relationship between Alim and Feyi, I’ve seen it described as insta-love which … doesn’t quite, for me, fit the bill. I think there’s insta-attraction, because they’re both incredibly hot, and insta-understanding, because they’re both people who have had their lives changed and shaped by intense personal loss. I think it’s this, at least initially, that draws them to each other—simply because it’s a significant part of who they are that’s impossible to share with someone who hasn’t experienced something similar (ask me how I know—no seriously, don’t, it’s personal). While there is a sense of connection between them from the beginning, and Feyi is, of course, hyper-aware of her attraction (alongside how inappropriate it is) the recognition that what they might feel for each other is love develops more slowly. They share conversation, understanding, jokes and most significantly their art (there’s a wonderful parallelism in Feyi’s response to Alim’s cooking and Alim’s response to Feyi’s installation: in their separate ways they communicate something that has profound meaning to the other person and alleviates a deep sense of loneliness they've both been carrying). Also do not get me started on Alim as a romantic hero: the man is beyond exquisite, with his cooking, and his beautiful house, and his juxtaposition of gentleness and strength. And, most importantly, the way he never wavers when it comes to Feyi.Obviously the end of the book is quite intense as the truth of Alim and Feyi’s relationship comes out, and some of the scenes with Alim’s family are genuinely hard to read. As I said in the early part of this monster essay, I appreciated not everything was magically fixed by the book’s conclusion, but I also appreciated the way that the social context never became a point of conflict for Alim and Feyi. I was worried they would doubt each other or doubt themselves—and I wasn’t emotionally ready for that because the book had already taken me on such a vulnerable-making journey. But thankfully we didn’t go there and Feyi got an opportunity to defend her choices, even though she shouldn’t have had to defend them. As she tells Nasir: “You have no ‘right’ to me, we weren’t together, we weren’t even exclusive. You’re not entitled to fuck me just because you were a decent human being and went along when I wasn’t ready to be intimate with you, or be mad because I ended up fucking someone else. You don’t get points for waiting for me. I didn’t use you, I didn’t lead you on. I went as far as I felt comfortable, and I stopped there.”Given how much scrutiny heroines, and indeed female characters in general, tend to receive in the genre (I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had editorial feedback along the lines that my women aren’t nice enough or thinking about the men in their lives enough--and maybe that's a problem with me and the way I write people orrrrrr....) I relished Feyi’s narrative freedom: she is allowed to who she is, to navigate her pain in the way she chooses to navigate it, to be selfish when it is healthy and righteous for her to be selfish, and to do what she needs to do to secure her own happiness, and always without compromise or contrition. Even her desire, right or wrong, appropriate or inappropriate, she owns: Feyi pushed away the irrational feelings of rejection (He doesn’t have to want you, she scolded herself) and focused on what did belong to her— this desire. This desire that pooled like traitorous flame, that wasn’t in response to someone else, that was coming from her and just her. She belonged to it, and it belonged to her, and that’s as far as it needed to go.Honestly, the only thing I was missing really, by the time the book wrapped up, was a touch more Joy (as in Joy the person, there was plenty of loving joy): there’s a hint or two that suggests her current relationship isn’t a disaster but, well, as much as I am against “resolve everything endings” I did need to know Joy was okay. Because Joy is the best.Okay, I need to wrap this up because I could talk for hours, days, forever about this book. And, uh, it feels like I literally have? Also it just goes to show much there is to admire and think about that I’ve barely mentioned how perfect the writing is, whether it’s theback and forth between Joy and Feyi, or the tentative unfurlings of trust between Alim and Feyi, its incisive explorations of Feyi’s emotions and desires, or the lavish food and architecture porn that had me absolutely swooning. I simply cannot recommend You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty highly enough: I’m sure there are people it's not going to work for but, for me, it’s one of the boldest, most powerful and … honestly … unabashedly romantic romances I’ve read since the last terrific romance I read. "
333,11,You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty,Akwaeke Emezi,333,2022-07-30,Alexander Peterhans,1,"This is my first book by Akwaeke Emezi. I recently read their essay on their surgeries, and I was struck by how beautifully it was written. So when I was offered this book by the publisher, I was all in.Dear reader, I shouldn't have started with this one. It's pretty terrible. It's a book about extremely beautiful people telling eachother how beautiful they are. A book about Feyi, whose beauty must be extolled every page at least once, if not more. Similarly beautiful men throw themselves at her, and it's just so gosh darn hard to choose one when you're that beautiful.Feyi used to be married to the saintly Jonah, who died in a horrible car accident they both were in. You don't get any sense who Jonah actually was, just that he was the love of her life.Feyi now is defined by that trauma, she barely has a personality, just the trauma. She gets to make horrible life choices, hurt people around her - She Deserves To Be Happy, because: trauma.She is the kind of person who constantly upgrades to a new fuckbuddy through her current fuckbuddy. That such a fuckbuddy might feel more for her, well, that's not her problem.Feyi approaches any and all people through the prism of sex. Does she want to fuck the person, is the main question. I don't think I ever see her talking to one of her partners, she seems to have no interest in them beyond their bodies. Most of the men in this book feel like a walking template, a cypher with a dick. And that's a problem, because the book makes a point of Feyi not wanting any deeper relation because of her trauma - you haven't had someone die in a car accident, how could you know, etc. But she doesn't seem interested in other people in the first place, it's not like she'd like to know more, but just can't.She's an artist, but she barely seems interested in actually being an artist. She's very interested in being a part of the art world, just not in the art itself. She makes art about, you guessed it, her trauma. She's painting self-portraits (because of course she is) in blood, but not using her own blood, or the blood of a loved one, she uses pig's blood - doesn't that sort of completely go against the symbolism of painting with blood in the first place? It's just another form of paint, it has no meaning beyond it.The second half of the book is about what feels like a very problematic relationship (laaarge age gap, insta-love, wonky power dynamic), that Emezi wants to convince you is actually pretty great. And it feels manipulative, and icky.I've seen some reviews presenting this as the literature equivalent of a romance novel, and it's not, it's just a pretty plain romance novel. The writing is full of romantic clichés, the dialogue is frequently cringeworthy, really quite cheesy.I'll try to forget this book, and perhaps, so should you.(Thanks to Simon & Schuster for providing me with an ARC through Edelweiss)"
334,11,You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty,Akwaeke Emezi,334,2022-06-09,luce (recovering from one big reading slump),1,"I deleted my original review after the author went on twitter to complain about it, taking one specific word out of context (i imagine the aim was to garner their followers sympathies). I used to be their fan and loved another book by them so I was massively disappointed when I learnt about this (i did not in fact read these tweets myself as i have made the blessed choice to steer clear of twitter).The actual reason why I hated this book was the romance, the way said romance was presented to us, the romanticisation of trauma, the way the narrative paints a specific character as a villain in order to exonerate the actions of the leads, and the wattpad writing ('She let out a breath she didn’t even know she’d been holding').Make of these criticisms what you will. Read this or don't, non me ne frega un cazzo.NB please if you are going to leave a comment make sure you use the author’s correct pronouns (they/them)"
335,11,You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty,Akwaeke Emezi,335,2022-06-12,Gabriella,1,"Let's start this off with my review meme.Here is yet another book that proves that Akwaeke Emezi and their oh-so-beautiful, oh-so-troubled autobiographical characters are morally bankrupt. (For more context on beauty and moral bankruptcy, please see this thread from one of my favorite Twitter users.) I'm constantly surprised by how many people review books based on how much they like the concept or how much they are attracted to the author, while ignoring the ACTUAL BOOK CONTENT. I have been confused about this for a while because while Akwaeke Emezi's clout continues to grow with every new publication, their craft continues to dwindle.I want to start here: Justice for Pre-Chapter-17-Nasir. To be clear, I mean the version of Nasir who was a real human character, not the one-dimensional incel monster Akwaeke Emezi turns him into by the end. Because that person makes no sense…his transformation is nonsensical and literally only occurs so that Emezi can make it seem like Feyi and Alim are just sTaR cRoSsED lOvERs and not arch-villains. But seriously, the way Nasir and Lorraine and all the nameless ""haters"" of this alleged love story are painted as the villains in this book…it's ridiculous. This only happens because the author ignores the INITIAL VIOLENCE that begins with Feyi and Alim’s actions…and THAT only happens because the author is subconsciously trying to justify their own reprehensible romantic and sexual actions.I literally don't even know how to review this ethical injury of a book. It was great and then I was literally groaning in frustration by the end. Usually when books make me feel a lot of emotions, that’s positive. But by the end of this book I literally feel like I did when I had my root canal. So how do I come up with a star rating for this terrible, visceral reading experience? I don’t know. Because I'm churchy, I'm going to run this root canal metaphor into the ground for a minute. So go with me: There is so much sexual tension in this book that feels enjoyably overindulgent, like all all-you-can-eat Swedish Fish in a floss-free world. But the scene where the villainous couple moves from the kitchen to Alim's bedroom literally felt like developing a cavity, because that was the precise moment all the aesthetics and vibes of the sugar rush turned into rot. By the time Feyi and Alim are making unabashed googly eyes at each other, and they start talking about HOW HIS CHILD’S HAPPINESS AND SANITY PALES IN COMPARISON TO THEIR ROMANTIC DESIRES, there was nothing sweet or enjoyable in this book. From that point on, everything Akwaeke Emezi does to this story feels like dental surgery. The author literally sucked all of the enjoyment right out of this story and made us writhe in discomfort for 60-ish more pages (because of course, with a book this bad, you got to see it through.) Okay so back to summarizing the story itself: Alim is a raggedy old man dating a girl the age of his kids. And Feyi…I don’t even know where to begin. This book is an Am I The Asshole post written in MFA format, and just like on Reddit, I can see right through the bullshit! I cannot BELIEVE Akwaeke Emezi sat down and tried to make us believe that Alim was wise and caring, or that Lorraine and Nasir were wrong!!!!! I need them, and anyone else who supports this book, to return to that AITA metapost about how our online ethics are moving towards a value system that frequently doesn't align with the rest of the world. And yes, before you say anything, these ethics extend to novels written by chronically online authors like Akwaeke Emezi. Because the people in and behind this book operate EXACTLY like the most egregious Reddit YTAs. Meaning, their minds have been so warped by 1) individualist notions of self-care and 2) elite capture of identity politics (read Olufemi Taiwo's stuff on this) that they fail to understand that while you can do whatever you want in your life, people WILL have feelings and terrible reactions to what you put them through. And people having terrible reactions isn't them being misogynist/whatever kind of bigot you want to throw out as a ""gotcha"" card. Their terrible reactions are because YOU STARTED THE TERRIBLE ACTIONS.While I felt that Emezi's political analysis in Bitter was disappointingly basic, their politics in this book are just plain awful. Like the fact that THEY TURNED THE CLEARLY BLACK AND WHITE ISSUE OF NOT FUCKING YOUR SON’S CRUSH IN THE VERY HOUSE YOUR SON COULD RETURN TO ANYDAY into platitudes about resisting moral binaries?!?!?! This is precisely why we need to bring back shame, and stop confusing feminism (or things like relationship anarchy) with a carte-blanche excuse for piss poor sexual behavior. This is how I know people aren't reading the original texts!!! Cause this is nowhere near the politics they should've gathered from them. Instead, Emezi (and people like them!) have the half-baked politics of your average Reddit menace. For Exhibit A of the Reddit-monster-morality, take the ridiculous “you don’t own me” lecture Feyi gives to Nasir. That is NOT the issue here, and I resent the bob and weave they tried to pull. The actual issue is the villainous couple literally stating that Nasir's feelings are TRIVIAL to their plans. They don’t care about their friend/son, if that care would require them to sacrifice even an inch of their impulsivity. For instance: they could’ve just waited a few months, given Nasir a chance to move on from his crush, and that would’ve helped SO MUCH. But they don't actually want to avoid hurting him, they only care about how his hurt inconveniences them. They only care because Nasir's feelings interrupt Feyi’s opulent, kinky summer vacation and Alim’s perception of himself as a good father. All that needed to happen was the villainous couple wait until THEY WEREN'T ON THE TRIP THE SON PLANNED to act on their lust. And that was only too much to ask because they are terrible, terrible people. Exhibit B of the Reddit-monster-morality is the call from Milan…which made no sense except as a lazy justification of the author’s nonsensical idea that Alim and Feyi are morally sound characters. (It's the equivalent of when the AITA OP says ""I talked about my terrible actions with my equally terrible friend and they said I'm right."") Milan and Feyi say that Nasir has had an easy life…are we not ignoring that his MOTHER died and that is the VERY SAME LOSS that allegedly makes it okay for Alim to do what he did?!?!?!? I know Akwaeke Emezi cannot truly be this dense, so it must be that they are just this selfish. It must be that their desire to justify a ""fictional"" situation that's very similar to something they did in real life is obscuring their common sense about good storytelling. Like, I really want to tell them to just BE selfish and immoral. Because this ridiculous bending over backwards to seem like a good person when they and their characters aren't is infuriating, and the book quality is suffering because of it. In summary, I cannot believe how despicable these people in the villainous couple are and the fact that they are our POV characters!!!! I detest Akwaeke Emezi for putting me in their mindset and trying to make their bastardized ethics seem like something I should root for or agree with. I feel like my soul needs a shower after reading this, and I hate each and every one of you that are recommending it to people. P.S. Stop putting this book on ""queer fiction"" lists!!!! When I'm trying to read queer romance novels, I want to read about two (or more!) queer people actually loving each other. This is another round of age-gap, power-dynamic, cishet chaos.P.P.S. I want to also share Alexander's hilarious, yet thoughtful Fool of Death review. His original post and the following chat discussion has been a really helpful way for me to keep thinking about this, and I specifically appreciate his rebuttal to the Akwaeke Emezi Hive's common refrain of ""y'all hate this book because you hate Black queer women being beautiful."" I wrote a way-too-long comment on his review about some of the other important topics in Fool of Death: desirability, neocolonialism, gentrification, and the troubled intimacies between many heteroromantic women and their lesbian friends. If anyone is interested in my planning-related reviews, this is the place to find that perspective. "
336,11,You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty,Akwaeke Emezi,336,2022-12-14,AsToldByKenya,2,"go to hell.this book sucks. why exactly are these two people together outside of lust.......cause they both have dead partners? well then, let everyone who has lost someone get married to each other. this is a forced ""romance"" that is just supported from you guys cause of the messiness of it all. She should not be dating her ""friends"" daddy and Feyi is a weirdo. The daddy is a weirdo as well, cause why would u date your son's friend/girlfriend. you weird. I hated it. which is saying a lot cause i LOVE mess. remind me not to take recommendations from yall. so happy I did NOT choose this for the lily reads bookclub cause i woulda got nasty. This book is trying to be deep and and sentimental but feels forced"
337,11,You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty,Akwaeke Emezi,337,2022-07-24,Candi,4,"I quite literally picked up this book for the very first time simply because of that intriguing title. Then I read the first sentence. After that hook, I couldn’t help but read the first couple of pages… the first chapter; despite the fact I was in the middle of a couple of other books. I set it back down and added it to my list knowing it wouldn’t be long. Then I read a friend’s review (Link Here) and couldn’t help myself. I also desperately needed to find out something about a bunch of damn carrots. It became an obsession of sorts and I found myself buying the book. I didn’t even bother borrowing the library copy I had in my hands in the first place. I needed to own this book!This was sexy and a ton of fun to read! Not a schmaltzy romance but one that I could read without a single eye roll. The writing is highly competent, the characters lifelike, and the settings were a huge draw to this reader at least – both New York City and the tropical island retreat. Feyi was a strong lead who acted with agency after having suffered a tragic lost several years prior to the start of the novel. I love that art can work so many wonders on people – both the artist and the viewer. I love what candid conversations can do to build a friendship and a relationship. I love the fact that I won’t soon forget this book. I can’t wait to read some of Akwaeke Emezi’s other novels as well as their memoir. “He loved people being messy as fuck – he said it was one of the best things about being human, how we could make such disasters and recover from them enough to make them into stories later.”"
338,11,You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty,Akwaeke Emezi,338,2022-05-24,karen,4,"NOW AVAILABLE!!!this is a romance novel. and i do not like romance novels. however, emezi's writing is always fire, so even though the skeleton of this is a pretty formulaic ""widow gets second chance at true love"" romance plot, it's a great version of this kind of story, so despite the many times i cringed whenever romance-writing crept into it, bringing its overblown cliches:""When I think about the ways I want to touch you, there's no space for anything else. I am consumed, utterly.""or when it leaned hard into one of my biggest pet peeves; unrealistic micro-evaluations of a character's fleeting facial expressions/vocal intonations (this example has BOTH!):A thread of sadness snagged on his last few words, and Feyi watched the grief move in a slow wave through his eyes.even with those things cluttering my path, there was more to it than those annoying bits and it is, at least, a very *complicated* love story. feyi is a young widow whose high school sweetheart jonah, whom she married right after college, died in a car wreck five years before the novel begins. since then, she's been defined by her grief, consumed with survivor's guilt, living with her best friend joy and keeping busy making her art, with no interest in romance, sex, or relationships....Feyi had moved down to New York, because if she was a monster, then so was the city, glorious and bright and everlasting, eating up time and hearts and lives as if they were nothing. She wanted to be consumed by the relentless volume of a place so much louder than she was, a place where her past and her pain could drown in the noise. Here, Feyi could keep her name and her unruined face, yet become someone else, someone starting over, someone who wasn't haunted. No one in New York cared about the vintage of sadness tucked behind her eyes and in the small corners of her smiles. She didn't have to drive, and she could cry on the train and no one would look, no one would care, because she didn't matter, and it was, honestly, such a relief to stop mattering.but after ""years of numbness,"" her sexual desires begin stirring again, and she's ready to start easing back into life and its pleasures. ""easing"" may not be le mot juste, as the first chapter finds her barebacking a stranger in a bathroom during a party, which is the kind of reckless behavior we're not supposed to applaud (and joy certainly gives her some grief over it), but it was just what feyi needed to kickstart her back into the deep end of the dating pool. feyi's hot girl summer/sexual reawakening involves three men whom she uses like stepping stones to return to life, beginning with milan, he of rawdog bathroom fame. she's gone through her five stages of grief, and now she's exploring the stages of love in all of its permutations:""...there are so many different types of love, so many ways someone can stay committed to you, stay in your life even if y'all aren't together, you know? And none of these ways are more important than the other.""what follows is a goldilocks romance plot where she test-drives a few different relationship models—with milan: great sex with no emotional intimacy, nasir: emotional connection with no passion, and alim: an older man who has also lost a partner and understands the core of her deepest pain. but, of course, there are some obstacles and turbulence best left unsaid for now. like most romance novels, it's more complex with emotions than with plot—everything moves very quickly except for the introspection, which is slow and sticky—and it embraces all the romance novel tropes: a beautiful protagonist, multiple attractive and appealing suitors who love talking about their feelings and their expectations and say shit like ""I very much want to respect your heart in this, too, which is why I'm asking about which boundaries feel comfortable for you,"" and, through them, she is catapulted into a fairytale dreamworld—getting her work into a prestigious art show alongside all of her favorite artists, introducing her to the artworld elite, staying in a celebrity chef's mansion in a tropical island paradise with frolicking monkeys and oh my god the food.it's a very sensual book—not just the sex, because reading about other people boning is whatever, but the food, the music, the vibrant foliage—feyi's is a full-scale multisensory reawakening, and that is the beauty of this book. not the jane austen parade of suitors or the ""hard and velvet and dew-tipped"" peens, but feyi's growing confidence as she emerges out of her trauma-coma and her willingness to engage with...everything again. if you want a fun drinking game, take a shot every time the word ""alive"" is used. here's a sampling:—It was the start of summer, she was alive and she was so fucking close to becoming what she wanted...—a roiling sweaty mess of alive—She was alive, like her therapist had taught her, and it was okay to live.—She was hers; she was alive; there was so much to do.—And, because Feyi was Feyi and she was alive, there was no way she could say no.—...because Feyi was herself, and alive, she kept going—It was a party, and she was drunk and alive.—To hell with the trouble this would bring, she was alive. —""...I think we're just figuring out how to survive a world on fire...that it's okay to be alive.""u drunk yet?so, i still don't like romance novels, but i'm rounding this one up to a four because honestly—i'm just impressed with emezi's raw talent. this is my fourth of their books, and each one has been so markedly different—Freshwater was challenging and structurally wild, The Death of Vivek Oji was a masterpiece but also straightforward enough for wine-soaked book clubs to appreciate, and Pet—well, i didn't really like Pet, but i was still impressed with what they produced for younger readers, even if i wasn't a fan. and even though i had to wade through a lot of blucky romance prose (every time alim called her ""sweetness"" (which is, for the record, TWENTY-TWO times), eyerolls ensued), when it's not being all romance-wincy, the dialogue is great, especially between feyi and joy, whose friendship is everything everything. i also appreciate that joy's character is a winky spin on the rom-com ""gay best friend"" trope, where the twist is that—unlike most rom coms, where the gbf is a boy—here the bisexual feyi has slept with her lesbian bestie. they hooked up for a while in the empty space before this book begins, but it never became a relationship, which is a shame because they complement each other so well and i'd rather see them together than feyi tits-deep in her messy-messy (but ""messy and alive"") situation. feyi is a compelling and flawed character and i get that we're meant to root for her because of what she's been through (and the fact that she makes a ""that's what she said"" joke automatically endears her to me), but the whole ""the heart wants what the heart wants"" shrug doesn't really mitigate every selfish decision, and she leaves some pretty significant destruction in her wake. love is often messy, but this one—yeesh. i do not envy what comes next for her. come to my blog!"

340,11,You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty,Akwaeke Emezi,340,2022-06-17,Jennifer ~ TarHeelReader,5,"Wowowowow. I read Akwaeke Emezi’s novel, Freshwater, which is a literary masterpiece. Since then, I’ve bought all of their books and “saved” them. Thank goodness I did not save this one and jumped right in. I’m not sure I’ve read another literary romance, and if I have, it definitely was not as original as this story.About the book: “New York Times bestselling author and National Book Award finalist Akwaeke Emezi (they/them) reimagines the love story in this fresh and seductive novel about a young woman seeking joy while healing from loss.”Feyi’s husband was killed in an accident five years earlier. She struggles with survivor’s guilt, especially because she walked away from the same accident. She is finally putting herself out there and dating again, but on her own terms. This is something I loved most about Feyi. She set standards for herself and she stuck to them. She keeps her guard up when she’s unsure, and she lets it down when she is ready. Feyi eventually lands on a tropical island and finds love in perhaps an unexpected way. Will she also find healing?I loved Feyi’s complexity and her story arc. I also loved her best friend, Joy. We all need a loyal friend like her.You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty is perfect to read for Pride or any time. It’s less than three hundred pages, reads quickly like a fever dream, and has me in further awe of the writing chops of Akwaeke Emezi.I received a gifted copy.Many of my reviews can also be found on my blog: www.jennifertarheelreader.com and instagram: www.instagram.com/tarheelreader"
341,11,You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty,Akwaeke Emezi,341,2022-05-25,Jasmine,4,"You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty is a contemporary romance with characters trying to process their trauma. Five years after the death of her husband, Feyi Adekola wants to try dating again. Her roommate and best friend Joy is equally excited for Feyi to get back out there. One day at a rooftop party, Feyi skips the dating part and leaps right into a steamy encounter with a handsome stranger. Over the summer, Feyi’s decision to start living again will shape her life in ways she never dreamed was possible for her again. From spicy sessions to finding new love. From her brownstone apartment and work as an artist to a tropical island with huge career opportunities. Although it’s not an easy switch for Feyi, she’ll have to work through her emotions, trauma, and grief. This romance novel solely focuses on Feyi’s POV. The writing style flows smoothly, making this a fairly quick read. However, it does delve into some heavy topics. It has themes of life, death, sexuality, art, pleasure, grief, and joy.This is the kind of romance that I generally prefer: contemporary and character-driven. It’s very spicy, but there’s more to the story than just that. The plot took an unexpected and immediate turn, romance-wise. I don’t have an opinion on the nature of the relationship, except that it happened fast, incredibly so. This novel is the third that I’ve read by Akwaeke Emezi, and though they have all been in different genres (literary fiction, memoir, romance), I have enjoyed them all. At this point, Emezi is an auto-read author for me. They can write anything, and I will gobble it up. I recommend this if you want a spicy beach read with emotional depth. Thank you to Atria Books for providing me with an arc via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. https://booksandwheels.com"
342,11,You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty,Akwaeke Emezi,342,2022-05-23,BookOfCinz,None,"Where do I even begin…. Like… a joke thing dis?!On one hand, I am so happy I get to read a book by this author that I actually understand what is happening because while I did enjoy reading Freshwater I had ZERO idea what it was about. On the other hand, this book was entirely basic and lacking substance… but I guess this is the author’s way of flexing their creative muscles and they aren’t wrong, if you can publish it, why not. In  You’ve Made A Fool Of Death With Your Beauty  we meet Feyi who is grieving the loss of her husband who died in a tragic car crash. After five years of grieving she figures its time to step out and maybe start dating, afterall she is still very young and with the encouragement of her friend Joy she decides to give it a go. Listen…. Nothing can prepare you for what Feyi calls dating after being celibate for five years. Yall, I am not a romance reader maybe that is why I was reading this and thinking, “wow… this is what we call romance…” “Is hoe-ing around romance?”“Big up you sis, a you seh date!”Honestly, Sis seh she ago follow her heart and nothing will get in the way and while in theory I believe you should… mi just never expect her fi follow it guh deh suh! Honestly, this book too chaotic… issa no for me.... I cannot Feyi went that far....I mean really?!!!P.S. Love the Caribbean rep in this book!"
343,11,You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty,Akwaeke Emezi,343,2023-03-22,K.J. Charles,None,"Read during the #TransRightsReadathon.Okay, first will someone please tell Faber and Faber this is a romance novel and could have had a human face cover like the US edition, you don't actually need to do this litfic thing. A superbly written book (well obviously from this author), which takes some classic tropes (second time around/boyfriend's dad) and does absolute wonders with them. Feyi's grief for her husband, killed several years ago in a traumatic car crash, is real and powerful and shapes everything. We see how much she needs to start living fully, how hard it is to do so. There's a wonderful scene where she realises part of what attracts her to Alim is his grief for his own lost wife: they can be alone together, in a way that she can't be with someone who hasn't gone through a comparable experience. Their lost partners are palpable in the new relationship: not as ghosts or shadows to be shaken off, but as presences to be brought in and fully acknowledged. It's deeply moving and doesn't detract from the relationship at all. Okay, with the wise stuff out of the way let us proceed to the Messy Shit. This is totally a 'rock up with your boyfriend and sleep with his dad' book. Feyi knows exactly how messy this is, and it is explored in depth, and the damage it does is real, palpable, and not handwaved away. Brilliantly, the author shows us a whole lot of things being simultaneously true while mutually incompatible. Alim has the right to pursue his happiness (his children have already destroyed a previous relationship of his, forcing him to end it). Feyi is not obliged to keep dating Nasir and he has no rights over her. Nasir and Feyi are not formally in a relationship and have never had sex. And *even so* Feyi dropping Nasir for his father is a phenomenally hurtful thing to do and of course it blows everything up, because it's not as simple as ""we weren't formally dating and your father and I are both free consenting adults"". Nasir is a wonderfully drawn character: a man who is almost but not quite a decent, caring, sensitive guy, because he's all those things until he's thwarted. And that's what this is: he says 'we can just be friends' but it's not what he ever meant, and once he realises he won't get his way, the underlying misogyny boils out. He's not even a bad person: he's a man living in a world that has taught him to believe, probably at an unacknowledged level, that women owe men sex if men pay them sufficient attention, and that a woman who is sexually available to other men must be sexually available to him. May I here add that the most satisfying moment in the entire book is when Nasir is going into Incel Rage mode and Feyi LOSES IT on him. Superb. I also want to note that Nasir and his sister are both kind of biphobic at least as far as their father goes, and decidedly self-centred, and we can really see how they were shaped by their mother's sudden death. They aren't hateful so much as damaged and desperate to keep their remaining parent to themselves. Once again, hurt people hurt people.This is all thinky stuff, which utterly underplays how much fun this book is. It is a terrific romance novel on its own terms, with a wonderfully sweary best friend, entertaining heroine, proper dilemmas and sacrifices for love, almost excessively cinnamon roll hero, and engulfing emotions splashed all over the pages. It's also as deeply thought and terrifically written as anything published as litfic [glares at Faber again], both in the emotions and in the lavish descriptions. Great stuff. "
344,11,You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty,Akwaeke Emezi,344,2022-06-05,Chelsea (chelseadolling reads),5,"I'm sitting somewhere between a 4 and a 5 star rating for this one, but I'm rounding up because this was truly just *so* good. I've been meaning to read something from Akwaeke Emezi for a long time because I've heard nothing but the best things about their writing, but I've always been a little hesitant because I'm not usually the biggest fan of literary fiction. When I found out that they were writing a romance (yes, this is a true adult romance!!) I immediately knew that this was the perfect place to start, and y'all, I was not disappointed. This novel follows our main character Feyi, who has decided to try to start dating again after the death of her husband, and a series of events that lead to her falling for a man that has also lost his wife. Going into this I knew it was going to be a heavier read, but I truly feel like this book struck a damn near perfect balance of heavy, heartfelt scenes and steamy, sexy moments. My only real issue is that I do feel like the main romance between Feyi and Alim felt a little bit rushed, but the beautiful writing and the eventual chemistry we see between them really made up for that for me and I absolutely recommend checking this one out. I really hope that Emezi has plans to write more romances in the future because I absolutely ate this up and I cannot wait to dive into their backlist now. This was so, SO good.CW: death of a loved one, car accidents"
345,11,You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty,Akwaeke Emezi,345,2022-07-16,Monte Price,1,"I knew when the masses wanted me to read this book that things weren't going to go well. I could sense the disturbance in the force... and maybe because I was not a fan of Bitter that came out earlier this year I went into this with already negative thoughts and feelings...I just... found this book lacked substance. It was almost laughable in the way that it tried to use grief as a means to pull these characters together. You're also gonna have to do some top tier writing to get me on board a book less than 300 pages where the characters want to end the book talking about marriage when they were together for maybe 25% and only knew each other for less than month. Again, I think if the discussions of grief and the fleeting nature of life had actually landed you could make some compelling arguments, but this was as rough drafts as rough drafts get. This was idea of a novel, not an actual novel.Really the enjoyable character in the book was Joy. That's partially because I think on some level Feyi was meant to be presented as unlikeable, even though the book spends the last hour of the audiobook trying to present Feyi's actions equally as fucked up and unlikeable but also completely justified with random appearances from a character so tangential to the plot I was clueless as to why he was being brought back in. So yeah. you weren't supposed to like her all the time, love that for Feyi, but if you're gonna be unlikeable I'm still gonna need the logic to logic and the math to math and that didn't happen until the last two pages and by that point the ship had sailed, I was rooting to hear about Joy. At least Joy was interesting. Hell Joy was so interesting that Feyi does all the things she criticizes Joy for doing and ends the book talking about marrying this man she just met. Like... clearly Joy was onto something.There's also something that rubs me the wrong way about how the love interest talks about a past male love interest they had, about how they were lowkey the one that got away and decides to now blow up his entire life to be with Feyi. Like much of the rest of the book, it wasn't giving.Clearly I'm in the minority because the romance girlies and the girlies I don't normally associate with romance have eaten this up, but this was just a raggedy mess from start to finish and I would detour all but those who were already eagerly anticipating this from picking it up."

 You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty
 is a deeply emotional love story about a young woman seeking joy while healing from loss while discovering herself as a person. It’s been five years since the accident that killed Feyi’s husband and she’s almost a new person now—an artist with her own studio, and sharing a brownstone apartment with her best friend, Joy, trying to leave her past behind. She’s even started dating the perfect guy, but their new relationship might be sabotaged before it has a chance. This new life she asked for just got a lot more complicated, and Feyi must begin her search for real answers. Can she release her past and honor her grief while still embracing her future? And, of course, there’s the biggest question of all—how far is she willing to go for a second chance at love?What I expected was a light, fun, tropical romance but this was an intense and moving story of love and grief. Emezi’s writing is both intense and beautiful. The plot of this book, though with the well-established trope of forbidden love, was still unique in the way it was structured. Emezi does a great job capturing all the complicated emotions that make the story feel really like the depiction of trauma and loss or grief. Still reeling from the death of her beloved, Jonah, Feyi is an emotional mess and prone to making mistakes after mistakes, but you can still relate to her character and her actions as her past becomes clearer. My main issue was with the romance. Personally, the romance seemed more about attraction and another Insta-love and I just couldn't connect to it. Since romance is the core of the novel, not connecting to the romance definitely made it less enjoyable to me. The journey from attraction to love felt too rushed and just didn't quite work for me. The second half got repetitive after a point and the ending felt extremely rushed. Many questions were left unanswered, the book wrapped up without resolving any of them or giving any closure to the characters or the readers. In the end, this was a beautifully written story. I'm not a big romance reader and still, I liked reading this book. Mainly because this wasn't a typical romance book with a set formula or cheesy dialogues. The book explores the themes of grief, friendship, and love in a unique manner which made it refreshing to read. This is a slow-burn, sometimes messy story and if you love romance, you will like this one.  Many thanks to the publishers Simon & Schuster and Edelweiss for the ARC.   "

Not recommended for YA and/or wholesome folks…. ⛔️ Now that is out of the way…. This book… ❤️ first impressions are not always what they seem. I did not think I’d enjoy this as much as I did. 😬 The main character morphs from un-likable/careless/juvenile to sensitive/caring/mature as her full storyline unfolds. The romantic relationship might not hit right for everyone- but their connection caught me- hook, line and sinker. 🥰 "
348,11,You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty,Akwaeke Emezi,348,2022-07-23,fantine,2,"You Made a Fool of Death with your Beauty Made a Fool out of MeI don’t even know where to start lol. Almost nothing about this novel worked for me. Firstly, I do not find the premise romantic in the slightest. When I found out Emezi was delving into the genre I was excited–but this is not a romance, this is a fucking horror movie. Being stuck in a house with men lusting after you, relying entirely on them for food, transport, shelter, and career opportunities sounds like my own personal idea of hell. I found the balance of power extremely unnerving. No matter how enchanting Feyi is I could not shake the discomfort of her being completely reliant on these wealthy men she barely knows. Not to mention  the age difference, Alim and Feyi are both adults sure, but it certainly adds to the power he holds. Also all the comments about him being old enough to be her father like?? ew. I also found the treatment of Nasir poor, by making him a villain AFTER Feyi hurt him wasted potential nuance, turning him into a violent caricature of his former self. What Feyi did was wrong, as much as the characters dramatically monologued about the consequences to their great love, there really seemed to be little fallout. It was strangely manipulative the way they handled Alim's daughters reaction, which I felt was completely understandable. This compulsion to turn characters to villainous caricatures, or erase their justified pain, was in incredibly poor taste. I found Feyi selfish and borderline manipulative at times. How are you going to act like Nasir is some pleb who doesn't understand art and grief like his father, when he experienced the same loss? why is his grief dismissable and Feyi's this deep and powerful force? Make it make sense.Perhaps most detrimental (as this is a love story) is the fact I don’t believe the love presented. A love that is meant to be so epic, healing, and worth sacrificing everything. Infatuation, yeah, obsession, absolutely, but capital L, Love?? The perfection of it was boring. It was so sanitary, each character taking turns to say the exact right romantic thing to one another, to the point it almost felt like a joke.Secondly, the writing. I am in awe of how some of these lines were okay’d. My major issue with Freshwater (which I still ardantly recommend) was the writing often felt like a display instead of an expression, with traces of writer’s workshops evident on every page. I had hoped their writing would have matured but, unfortunately, I can’t confidently say I noticed progress. The author's tendency toward lavish phrasing is rarely effective, mostly it feels feel self-indulgent and flashy, not serving the story but rather a display of technique. Some, when pertaining to physical descriptors or sensations, work well–one of my only positives of his novel is the attention to aesthetic. I loved the descriptions of clothing, hair, makeup as well as the mouth watering food. But mostly the wording is straight-up awkward. I am not being dramatic when I say I laughed out loud, some examples;*quotes taken from ARC*“his eyes were controlled murky ponds” this is the way the romantic lead’s eyes are described during a scene that is meant to be thick with romantic and sexual tension?? MURKY PONDSThen regarding the same character ”his slurried eyes” WHY IS THE ROMANTIC LEADS EYES CONJURING IMAGES OG MUD AND SEWAGE“Feyi wondered how they looked standing next to each other, deep blood and a long cloud, both adorned, both dark as two different nights” the description is in reference to their clothing but im sorry describing someone as a long cloud is so funny to me”[character’s name] control slipped for just a second, strong feeling bolting through his face like lightning” the feeling what through his face now”Her face was pinned to the blooming sky” ?? her gaze?? Or her whole face?? Like am I crazy or is that a bad turn of phrase“Being so close to him felt like a thousand welcome insanities against her skin” As far as I can tell this is not a reference to anything? insanities or a thousand don’t really hold significance so why specifically write this?? Cos it sounds pretty?? Not enough it's giving wattpad tbhClearly this book is not for me. I must say however it started off very strong, the bathroom scene was steamy and Feyi and her best friend Joy’s New York life was really enjoyable. I honestly felt more connection between Joy and Feyi than Feyi and, well, anyone else. Why was this not a romance between them? the men were so boring in comparison to Joy how tf am I meant to root for them. ALSO I am majorly confused by the timeline–the book's premise is that Feyi has not been with anyone since her husband's death, and yet it is dropped that she and Joy did in fact have a romantic/sexual relationship... when was this meant to be? If Feyi and her husband met super young? Was it an open relationship? If it was after his death why does it not 'count'??? messy as, like?As previously mentioned I adored the time taken to appreciate aesthetics, especially as Feyi herself is an artist. The descriptions of her clothing, makeup and hair as glossy, sparkly, shiny, pearlescent, rainbow etc. was beautiful. Even if the descriptions of her art itself were lacklustre. I always think it is best to write about fictional art in terms of what it evokes from the character, to allow the reader their own interpretation and avoid tackiness. When described so literally Feyi’s art lost any magic or mystery, and kinda seems bad. SORRY. Lacked the heart and intrigue of Freshwater, which allowed one to excuse certain faults. This novel is so hollow and empty, I felt like I was being pranked whilst reading it.*REVIEW OF AN ARC*"

Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestBefore reading this book, I strongly urge you to check out this author's interview with Trevor Noah via The Daily Show. Regardless of how you feel about the book, it's a very valuable interview because it puts the author's intentions into perspective and talks about how they included some of their own thoughts about love, grief, and art into the book. I also appreciated their love of romance novels (including the old Mills & Boon) and how you can appreciate the oldies for laying the groundwork for the far more feminist- and diversity-friendly contemporary romance novels of today, which give happy endings to people from all walks of life.***WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD*** I liked the interview and I appreciated what this author sought to do with YOU MADE A FOOL OF DEATH WITH YOUR BEAUTY. But my thoughts on the book ended up being kind of convoluted and not totally favorable. I feel like I always end up feeling this way with Emezi's work. They're a very-- I want to say transgressive author? In that, their works seem like they're supposed to challenge the way you think about society and how it works and make you uncomfortable on purpose. YOU MADE A FOOL OF DEATH WITH YOUR BEAUTY is a romance, but it's not a straightforward one. The heroine, Feyi, is aching from the death of her husband, who she has immortalized and enshrined in art and memory. I'm reading another book right now that also explores these concepts, which is called SOMEDAY, MAYBE by Onyi Nwabineli. Both books show that there is no linear path to love or healing. In SOMEDAY's case, the heroine takes solace from her friends and family. In YOU MADE A FOOL, the heroine turns to sexual release. No one can really hold up, so she hooks up with people who are undemanding and easy, whether it's the pretty party boy, Milan, her own best friend, Joy, or Nasir, the nice guy who seems to think that he can save her from herself, like a charity case.Nasir ends up trying to woo her by taking her to his family home on a Caribbean island, where it turns out that his father, Alim, is a famous Michelin-starred chef. He's also a bisexual silver fox hottie that Feyi kind of sort of has a crush on, and maybe it's the lipstick and the silver nail polish, or maybe it's the thought of the forbidden, but suddenly this book starts feeling a lot like Katee Robert's YOUR DAD WILL DO, social subterfuge edition. As soon as Nasir leaves the house for an extended period of tim, she's all over his dad like a pan on a stove, and yeah, they do have chemistry and I think he ends up being a stabilizing influence for her and also a safe space because of their shared grief and love of art, but it's way messier than what I bargained for (the sleeping around and unprotected sex and messy queer girl summer stuff, I could stand behind, but going on an all expenses paid trip with your friend you know wants to sleep with you and then doing it with his dad felt kind of... weird). The summary also doesn't really prepare you for the dad-fucking element. ""Forbidden"" romance could mean anything.So, here are some things that I liked. The portrayl of queerness and Blackness and the unapologetic sexuality of the main character and her friend. Joy, and the way she tried to hold her friend accountable while also still being supportive of her choices. The message that women don't really ""owe"" men anything (even though Nasir paid for all Feyi's shit, she didn't owe him sex, or even the truth, really). The line when Alim is like ""it's not your house, boy."" (Owned.) The food porn and descriptions of the art. The blood thing was very Damien Hirst and the wedding ring thing reminded me of something Tabaimo might do. Neither artist is to my personal taste, but their work is both subversive and disturbing, which I think Feyi would appreciate. The writing is also gorgeous. There's a lot I highlighted while reading. Emezi has a great way with words, and everything is very sensory.YOU MADE A FOOL OF DEATH did not really work for me as a romance, and I did not really like the story. I think it's more lit-fic than it is a romance, even though it straddles both genres, and sort of defies categorization. Framing it as an avant-garde work will probably help it find its target audience, as will knowing going in that it's an age gap romance that flies in the face of social convention, and has the heroine hooking up with her friendzoned boy ""friend's"" dad.2 to 2.5 stars"
350,11,You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty,Akwaeke Emezi,350,2022-03-19,Christine ,2,"2 starsOh boy. Big outlier here. This book was simply not written for me. I did not care for the protagonist (virtually always a nonstarter for me), I didn’t learn anything (bummer), and I didn’t feel anything (except the desire to finish it up). Also too much navel-gazing romance for me and too much gratuitous profanity. Lots of good reviews are in so please take a look at those before following my lead. Two stars for the author’s excellent writing skills. I would like to thank Net Galley, Atria Books, and Ms. Emezi for the ARC invitation. Opinions are mine alone and are not biased in any way. "

352,11,You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty,Akwaeke Emezi,352,2022-06-01,Marieke (mariekes_mesmerizing_books),4,"Akwaeke Emezi did it again! So different from Vivek Oji and still … the beautiful writing, the tangible emotions, trying to make the impossible possible; all similarities to Vivek Oji.This book is about grief, about love, about finding yourself again after losing a loved one, about sexuality, but most of all, it’s a tribute to each Black person in the world. When I started reading, I immediately thought of Seven Days in June; I felt the same (Black) unconditional love. While I loved that book, I loved this one even a bit more; Akwaeke’s writing qualities are simply extraordinary. Just like the cover of this story (take a look at the UK cover too, it’s breathtaking and fits the story so well!), their writing is incredibly vibrant and energetic, and it made me hunger for more.You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty seems like a simple story, a woman trying to find love again after losing her first love, and yet, it’s so fascinating at the same time. It’s a book to dive in without much knowledge and to read breathlessly as the words penetrate each fiber of your body. I had to get used to the story at first, because it starts so differently than Vivek Oji, but after reading several chapters, I savored it until the very end. I highly recommend this amazing book to anyone who loves character-driven love stories and exquisite writing.Actual rating 4.5 stars. I‘ve rounded it down for now but am still thinking about rounding it up because I loved it so much.

353,11,You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty,Akwaeke Emezi,353,2022-06-05,Brandice,4,"It’s been 5 years since Feyi lost her husband in a tragic accident. She hasn’t felt the same way about anyone since. After a hookup at a summer party, Feyi meets another guy, Nasir. He’s into her but she’s cautious, not sure if she’s ready for something serious and not wanting to repeat what happened recently. They begin hanging out and agree to take it slow and become friends first. Nasir offers Feyi the opportunity to show her art at an upcoming show in his home country, a tropical island. Despite some reservations about their status, Feyi can’t pass up this opportunity. Only when they arrive does Feyi learn who Nasir’s dad is, a well-known celebrity chef, Alim. Feyi quickly begins working to reel in her underlying attraction to Alim — Will she succeed? Will she ever feel alive again or did she lose that part of herself in the accident? With a great mix of characters and an island setting, You Made a Fool of Death With Your Beauty is a good summer read with plenty to think about — Grief and loss, love and living, friendship and more. I did not agree with all of Feyi’s decisions, but for the most part, still liked her as a main character. I enjoyed her friendship with her best friend Joy too. I listened to the audiobook, narrated by Bahni Turpin, and she was fantastic!"

He’d also screamed over her cold body on a merciless beach, just like Feyi had screamed on that dark road. Those were moments that broke timelines, that cut them so deep and so bloody that they would never stitch back together again, that the life before the cut was as dead as the person who was lost. Just memories through a haze of hurt. 
 This is the third adult novel by the Nigerian born multidisciplinary artist and writer whose extraodinary debut novel “Freshwater” was told from an Igbo spirituality worldview with multiple self/split narrators, and whose second, equally literary novel “The Death of Vivek Oji” explored similar ideas of gender fluidity, otherness, identities and prejudice within Nigerian society, in perhaps a more conventional/accessible way. This novel is of a very different genre – to quote the author from Twitter, it “is a romance novel. It is not ‘literary’ whatever that means – it was meant to be a romance novel, it was written as a romance novel, and I love that it’s a romance novel. If you’re going in expecting it to be like my literary fiction work, please know that it’s not literary fiction. It is romance. If you hate romance novels but want to give it a try because I wrote it, wonderful! It’s still going to be a romance novel when you read it. They also set out the high weight of profanity in the novel and the sexual openness of the “queer Black girls” in it and warn “if you’re a pick me who loves respectability, you might be offended by these characters” Which is a pretty good overview of the book – although a shame it was part of an extremely ill-advised rant at those at Goodreads who gave their book negative reviews and who they pretty well accuse of being racist and anti-gays. Anyway the book itself tells the story of an American (of Nigerian descent) Feyi Adekola a conceptual/installation artist who five years before the book lost her husband in a car crash (a subject she circles in her work where she paints with animal blood and has a hanging installation of wedding rings with her partners still bloodied ring among them).  Now for the first time since the accident, and encouraged by her roomate and one-time lover now best-friend Joy (a lesbian with, in Fey’s view, a rather doomed penchant for previously straight married women) she re-enters the dating scene with something of a bang, having explicitly described, unprotected sex with Milan who she meets at a houseparty. After a fling with Milan she moves on to his friend Nasir, although with the relationship moving much more slowly and not consummated when Nasir arranges for her work to be displayed at a prestigious art exhibition on his home Caribbean Island and for her to stay with him at the luxury house of his father there. Arriving on the Island she finds that Nasir’s father is the 2 Michelin Star chef Alim Blake, and although Alim is some twenty years her elder, the two form a secret but deep connection founded not just on mutual attraction but on their shared hurt and loss (the bisexual Alim having lost Nasir’s mother in a swimming accident some years before). Alim and Fey’s burgeoning relationship plays out in the luxury and paradisical setting of Alim’s house, against the background events of the art exhibition and after-party, and against the open hostility of Nasir and his sister Lorraine who, already embarrassed at a previous affair their father had with a man, now see her as a gold-digging groupie usurping their mother’s place).The Island part of the novel in particular is set in a world of extreme and rather unbelievable indulgence, privilege and luxury – for example here is what happens when Feyi arrives at Alim’s home “They parked under a steel-beamed trellis dripping with bougainvillea, and Feyi stepped out of the car. There was entirely too much to look at—her eyes could only snag on the details a few at a time: the soaring birds of paradise along the pathway, the albino peacock watching them from the grass, the side door inlaid with mother-of-pearl.” – accompanied by heavy name dropping of real life celebrity artists who actuallly appear in the book as side characters. And it is easy to react negatively to this. But in the author’s defense this is very much part of the genre and crucially here the author reserves the world of decadence, richness and art for black characters – for example featuring a host of black artists (previously unknown to me) such as Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze, Moses Dumney, Katherine Agyemaa Agard and Charmaine Bee. Overall I try to judge a book against two criteria – did it work for me personally as literary fiction and did it succeed on its own terms. The first would be probably a two star (albeit there is some excellent writing on trauma and grief such as my opening and closing quotes) but the latter is 5 stars, so my overall rating is a compromise rounded down for the Twitter attacks. 
So, madness and mess. Something that took up space. Something that felt furiously alive, because survival could be so very, very angry. Feyi had seen a glimpse of it in Pooja during their lunch, had felt it in herself while confronting Nasir at the museum. Madness and mess, anger and life, but the anger was specific, a fire fueled by grief. Heart-rending, cloth-rending grief, but it couldn’t return to that place she and Alim had talked about, the place you might never get out of. You weren’t alive in that place.

358,11,You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty,Akwaeke Emezi,358,2022-08-09,Meags,5,"5 StarsI devoured this story like a woman half-starved. The prose, the characters, the depth of emotions elicited… it was all absolutely stunning. It was one of those stories with, what I like to call, first-page magic—I cracked it open, read a passage, and then didn’t come up for air until a few hours had passed; I was that instantly engrossed.Granted, this was a story whose themes I was straight-up expecting to not gel with, having read some reviews prior to reading. The story deals heavily in loss and grief, and has all sorts of tropes at play within the romantic element, including second-chance love, an age-gap, and even taboo-ish dynamics between the main couple of this story. I honestly try and avoid most of these themes/tropes in my reading, for the most part, but thank goodness I threw caution to the wind and gave this a chance (thanks to the eye-catching cover(s) and the standout title), because all the things I usually sidestep were handled so expertly and deliberately here, that I found myself loving these aspects of the story more than anything else, which was a true and pleasant surprise on my part.I won’t give away details of the plot, just know this is one of the most beautiful romances I’ve read in years. It’s the kind of book that was a real experience for me, and I only hope that other readers give it chance and go into it with an open mind and an open heart. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! <3 "

Psyche or Eros? i can’t pick, i love them both. katee really nailed the “i have to kill you so let’s get married”it’s safe to say that katee put her whole thrussy into this and more. i can’t wait to read more from the dark Olympus series the smut…if there’s anything i trust katee can do, it is that i trust her to write the most glopping glooping smut there is and that’s exactly what she gave us. home girl delivered. i was constantly using the pink and red tabs to bookmark those special scenes and i ran out?!?!? had to go to the store to get some more because god damn.i especially appreciate katee robert for keeping her cast of characters diverse. psyche being a plus size queen? babes i love you already. Oh and the crossover episodes with Hades and Persephone?!? omfg i was cheeking, i love when authors do that. the only critique i really have for this book was that it was kinda repetitive like we didn’t need Eros mentioning he thinks he’s a monster every 50 pages but oh well"
361,12,Electric Idol,Katee Robert,361,2022-05-10,Nilufer Ozmekik,5,"Oh my goodness! Dark Olympus series is getting so much hotter at each book! When I read the first book, I couldn’t put it down the stimulating, blasting, sexy, fiery story of Persephone and Hades! I thought the second book may not satisfy my expectations but now I’m taking my words back because Psych and Eros’ palpable chemistry ten times more explosive than dynamites!  A killer, cruel, vicious hero who is fated to become his mother’s right hand that holds the dagger to finish the massacres and a ultra smart, curvy, cunning, strategist, influencer, practical heroine agree for fake marriage unless poor heroine want her heart ripped out by cold blooded hero who obeys his mother Aphrodite’s wishes!  We return back to ultra modern version of Olympus to continue the story where it’s left, focusing on Psyche who is forced to marry with Zeus unwillingly for being next Hera!  The last party she attends ends with being busted by paparazzis when she leaves the restrooms accompanied by notorious Eros. Actually she doesn’t have any bad intention to stuck in this place with her mother Demeter’s archenemy Aphrodite’s killer son! But when she sees him hurt, covered in blood, only thing she wants is patching him up. Of course being in the vicinity of his killer body makes her cough! This man is smoking hot! And she’s not immune to his seductive manners. But she’s caught by the press. Aphrodite’s solution to fix their tarnished reputation is killing Psyche. Correction: ordering Eros to kill her! But Eros cannot finish the job for the first time. He wants to possess this smart, tempting, cunning beauty! He’s gonna make her his by asking her to marry him. If they get marry sooner he can provide his full protection. Psyche has no other choice: she doesn’t only think her own life, she also thinks her sisters’ well beings because Aphrodite can strike against them to avenge their mother. But as you may imagine, the mutual attraction, flying sparks put their bed on fire! They’re created for each other! The steamy scenes between them are smoking hot! I loved their story more! Especially the final chapters about political maneuvers and balances, power games in Olympus are perfectly depicted.  I enjoyed to read about a heroine who is not only pretty face but also carries an ultra big brain to survive at the political jungle by forming intelligent strategies.  I think the third book will be about Callisto and Zeus! From the beginning of the series: Callisto picked my interest as fiery, bold, unique character reminded me of Katherina character from Shakespeare’s “ Taming of shrew” Those books are growing on me! I cannot wait to read the next one! I gave Persephone and Hades’ story five stars.If I had a chance, I would give Psyche and Eros’ story to five and half stars! It’s so hooking, engaging, tempting, hot, irresistible!  I highly recommend it to the genre lovers! It’s freaking AMAZING!Special thanks to NetGalley and SOURCEBOOKS Casablanca for sharing this digital reviewer copy with me in exchange my honest opinions."
362,12,Electric Idol,Katee Robert,362,2022-01-03,Cait Jacobs (Caitsbooks),4,"I finished this book in one day, it was so addictive.Electric Idol takes place in the same world as Neon Gods, this time following Persephone's sister Psyche, and Aphrodite's son Eros. I have always been a fan of the myth of Eros and Psyche, so I was excited to see Katee Robert's interpretation, and I ended up really loving it.The characters are perhaps my favorite part. Psyche is a plus-sized social media influencer, who understands how to play Olympus's power games while still remaining a good person in her heart. Eros is Aphrodite's fixer, forced to do her dirty work, and believes himself to be a monster. Their dynamic was so fun to read. They begin as enemies, forced into a marriage of convenience, and I loved watching them fall for each other.The world-building is slightly expanded on from Neon Gods, but it's still fairly vague. That said, it wasn't vague enough to bother .me. I understood everything I needed to for the plot. The plot itself is fast-paced, with action and political intrigue mixed into the romance. There were some points where I felt we moved a little too fast, especially towards the end, but it didn't take away too much from those scenes.In the end, Electric Idol is an incredibly fun read, perfect for fans of romance and Greek mythology. I can't wait for the next book in this series!Rating: 4.5/5 Stars Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for giving me an eARC to review! "
363,12,Electric Idol,Katee Robert,363,2022-02-23,jessica,3,"an interesting spin on the story of psyche and eros. obviously, a lot of liberties are taken with the myth so that it fits into KRs world of dark olympus.again, i think the world-building is what makes this series so interesting. the fact that the gods (zeus, demeter, aphrodite, etc) arent actually gods, but titles/positions, to be filled by members of higher society in the modern city of olympus, is really cool and makes for interesting power dynamics.and while i did enjoy reading about different characters in this world, the writing wasnt my favourite. i didnt have an issue with it in ‘neon gods,’ so im not sure why i didnt like it in this sequel. but the writing reads like a bad fan fiction of her own book. however, i think if you liked the first book, you will definitely want to pick this up as its basically more of the same.thanks sourcebooks casablanca for the ARC!↠ 3.5 stars"

(obviously i read this for the smut why else do i read things)for how “dangerous” eros was, this was pretty damn vanilla lmaoi would like to give credit for a minute (shocking ik; who ever thought i could do anything but complain) to the mcs, no matter how absolutely insufferable eros’s inner monologue was, because they were both really fuckinghot sometimes. psyche was our gorgeous plus-sized fmc, and the attitude this woman had was 10/10, put eros in his place multiple times, right where he belongs 👑“I like your hair up.” “I assure you that your preferences have absolutely nothing to do with how I’ll dress or act in the future.”👑 “I’m marrying a chaos monster.”“Then I guess we’re both monsters.” “Cute.

You’re mine now, and I protect what’s mine.” “That’s very patriarchal of you.”👑 “…until you know exactly who you belong to.” “I belong to myself.” 👑 “No one will harm you while you’re mine.

Didn’t I just tell him this morning that I belong to no one but myself? “I’m not yours.”👑 “I won’t let anyone hurt you, Psyche.”“That’s rich coming from you, someone who intended to hurt me less than twenty four hours ago.”like oh my god thank you from the bottom of my heart for making fun of his ~possessive tendencies~ 💀psyche had her annoying moments but was generally really cool and really hot and just really slay overall.eros was also just hot when he wasn’t parading around acting like a ~possessive mafia daddy~ he 100% had his good moments and i didn’t hate his character at all, just the some of the shit he would say and think.also ofc homeboy had issues, his mom was so awful to him. in conclusion i’m just glad he’s with psyche because she can handle him and teach him to not be weird and say weird things and “claim” people. but they were both so hot fr ____________________ ❦_______________________one more thing is i don’t care about the politics in Olympus. don’t care at all.don’t care for the 100 page justification for why psyche and eros need to fake date.y’all are fake dating just admit it we don’t need a whole 100 pages dedicated to ~important meetings~ and ~alliances~.you could be dedicating that space for smut. i’m sureeverybody would like that much better.anyways i’m tired of Olympus politicsso gn."

367,12,Electric Idol,Katee Robert,367,2021-12-18,Alexis Hall,None,"**book received from NG**I think I liked Electric Idol more than I did Neon Gods. That is, I think it’s more consistent throughout while lacking some of the highs of the first book (that throne scene, right?). Also I think the marriage of Eros and Psyche is a bit less iconic than Hades and Persephone myth-wise—or at least it is for me—so the story felt a touch less resonant in general. On other hand, KR brings her usual awareness of consent, agency, social and sexual power dynamics to the material so … err … there’s no allegories for sinful lust here or locking women up in adamantine chains (or, at least, I feel if women were locked up in adamantine chains in a KR book it would be because they were up for it). As I mentioned in my review of Neon Gods, I struggled a bit with the world-building in that book: not because it was flimsy but because it was both flimsy AND TOO MUCH. I’m glad to say that it felt like there was less work to do in that regard now the setting had been established, although the background intriguing continues to be the least interesting aspect of this series. It’s just distracting, compared to the complexities of the character dynamics—and tends to drag the pacing down.Anyway: the deal here is that Eros is his mother’s hitman and fixer and general on-call monster. After he’s caught on camera with Psyche (despite there being nothing between them), Aphrodite commands him to literally murder her. Except Eros, troubled by either his conscience or his genitals, can’t bring himself to do it and ends up marrying Psyche instead, in the hope this will keep her safe from his mother.There’s a lot about this to make me squeeful. I do love me a marriage of convenience. And, despite how problematic a trope it is, a hero who believes he’s a monster. And I found I had a better sense of who Psyche was compared to Persephone. I’m always here for a fat heroine (I’m using the word fat in the descriptive, rather than pejorative sense, and also because it’s the word the heroine uses for herself) and, much like Tink in A Worthy Opponent, I feel KR does a fantastic job of allowing Psyche to be confident in who she is while not pretending that deviating from conventional beauty standards is a walk in the park socially-speaking. There’s a really well observed moment where Psyche has just run off with Eros and he pulls the ol “worry not, I will buy you an entire new wardrobe” move that is so popular with romance heroes. Whereupon Psyche turns round and is like, that is literally not possible for someone shaped like me because finding clothes to fit my body is takes time and care. It’s also just nice to have a fat heroine and a conventionally attractive hero who is non-fetishistically just *gone* for her. Again, there’s shades of Tink and Hook here, but Eros and Psyche are very much their own people. For all I really need to interrogate my love for “I am a monster for everyone but you”, I sincerely enjoyed Eros as a hero. I liked how damaged he is, and has been, by the violence in which he’s been forced to participate, and it was meltingly sweet how profoundly he reacts to Psyche’s acts of kindness and care-taking (themes that continue from the first book). The bonking is probably best characterised as rough vanilla—but I appreciated the focus on intimacy and intensity over throwing in kink for the heck of it. It felt right for these two characters, especially Eros, who above all craves closeness and connectedness. All of which said, while I loved the characters and was swept along with them for at least the first half of the book, the wheels came off for me just a little at the 60% mark. This is when the intriguing comes back with a vengeance—with Aphrodite trying to flat out murder Psyche regardless of the political fallout, and the inclusion of a set of scenes that seemed to be primarily set up for the next book (of which I believe Helen is the heroine*), all of which just got in the way of Eros and Psyche working their way towards a recognition of mutual love. There’s some emotional conflict thrown in as well, with Eros thoroughly convinced he is undeserving, and Psyche scared for her heart: but while the former felt fully embedded in his character, the latter felt … less so? I mean, I have nothing but empathy for romance characters with wary hearts, who are afraid of having them broken, but on this occasion it felt like a delaying tactic rather than a natural obstacle towards a HEA. (Again, compare to Meg in Learn My Lesson whose emotionally damaged wariness is absolutely integral to her character from the moment she appears on page).Plus, I think I was looking for … more? Less intrigue, more emosh, especially because Eros and Psyche are so amazing on page together. I appreciated that Psyche had both the courage and wherewithal to resolve the external “imma murder you now” conflict, without recourse to violence or ethical compromise. But I wish there’d been more of the relationship between Eros and Aphrodite: at the point the book opens, Eros basically knows she’s manipulating him, so he’s mostly just annoyed and frustrated, chafing against her control, and never feels truly vulnerable to her. Given how much emotional power she’s wielded over him over the course of his lifetime I guess I wanted to see him work through that more, even if just with Psyche (rather than ‘trying to murder his wife’ simply being the last straw in a succession of dick moves his mother has subjected him to). And I guess—in a book inspired by the Greek gods and the myths around them—it fits that Aphrodite is just a capricious, irrational prick who emotionally abuses her own son and is arbitrarily fatphobic. But … I don’t know. I don’t think a touch of nuance would have damaged her as a villain (especially because Demeter is ambitious, complex and seems to be treading this blade-thin line between loving her kids and using them).Before I wrap this, I should mention that both Eros and Psyche are bisexual in the way that Hades and Persephone are bisexual in Neon Gods. And I continue to be ambivalent about it. Which is not to say (as I said last time) bisexuality only counts if you’re screwing every gender you can lay your hands on but I’m kind of noticing a trend, not just with this series, but in other romances, where characters who end up in m/f relationships are textually flagged as bisexual. And yet, how can I say this, the bisexuality doesn’t seem to *mean* anything or the shape the character in any way. At which point, it’s just a word on the page. And I don’t think this is true of KR, because many of her characters feel queer (well, feel queer to me but that’s just me, I’m not the queer pope) and are engaged in queer relationships, but I don’t think I like this trend in general. And I’m definitely not trying to gatekeep who gets to write bisexual characters, or how bisexual characters should be written: but it’s hard for me to feel represented by characters who are queer identified but for whom its nothing more than a socially progressive label that doesn’t seem to have anything to do with who they are or how they exist in the world. But again, who knows. Maybe for some people queerness is that simple. And, y’know what, if it is… I guess that’s cool. Anyway, as ever my attempt to discuss a KR book has led me down various rabbit holes. I will say, that I’m continuing to find this series fascinating and I’m excited to see where it goes. I absolutely loved the relationship between Eros and Psyche, and the way KR consistently re-works guilty-pleasure romance tropes into entirely-guiltless-pleasures is a masterclass in the sexiness of agency, equality and consent between sexual and romantic partners. I will never not admire the fuck out of that.* I rescind this objection. I have just heard the next book is Helen, Achilles and Patroclus. SET IT UP ALL YOU LIKE, KR."

371,12,Electric Idol,Katee Robert,371,2022-01-15,Madison Warner Fairbanks,5,"Electric Idol by Katee Robert2nd book in the Dark Olympus series. Paranormal romance. Can be read as a stand-alone. High heat level. Psyche and Eros. They’ve know each other for years of society parties. Never really getting close, but aware of the other’s presence. After getting caught by the press in a rather innocent but compromising photo, they create an illusion to save her life. The 13 rule the world and Psyche and Eros will do what they must to survive. Good thing their attraction is off the charts hot for each other. Maybe they will survive. Typically I don’t enjoy a mythological world of confusing Gods with multiple names and attributes but the author focuses here 90% on the couple, and their reactions to each other, rather than the world itself. Psyche and Eros are incredibly hot and steamy together. It starts out as just a front to their world but soon the two are deeply involved and emotionally entangled. I loved that their main concern was for the other. So swoony. This was my second book by this author. Both were high emotions and high heat with deep love by the end.🎧 I listened to an audiobook version narrated by Zara Hampton-Brown and Alex Moorcock. The two alternated POV chapters and did multiple voices. I preferred the female narrator because I think she did a better job of distinguishing between voices, both male and female. Both projected emotions with drama and heat and made the performance engaging. I listened to the first few chapters at 1.0 to get the full resonance of the voices but moved to 1.5 afterwards for my normal talking speed. I don’t feel that I lost any integrity at the higher speed. I received a copy of this from NetGalley and Dreamscape Media. "

 “You might be a monster, Eros, but you’re my monster.”
Electric Idol is the second book in the Dark Olympus series by Katee Robert. It can be read as a standalone. If you want a spicy retelling of Eros and Psyche this is the book for you!This book is a dual POV and it follows Eros, son of Aphrodite, who has been ordered to kill Psyche. Eros struggles to complete this order by his mother, and instead decides to marry Psyche. This fake marriage lines get blurred while tensions rise in Olympus. Overall, I really enjoyed this book, do I prefer Neon Gods? Yes, but I didn't hate this. I did find myself bored during some parts but I loved their relationship and I am obsessed with Eros. WHAT A MAN. The spice was amazing like usual from Katee Robert (let's just say Eros has a lot of mirrors in his home)Thank you to NetGalley and Sourcebooks for this eARC, ARC was provided in exchange for honest review."

Electric Idol was slightly better than Neon Gods for me, but not by much. It has an interesting concept, with this being a Psyche and Eros retelling.Eros is an assassin for his mother and she tells him the next person he needs to take out is Psyche. In order to protect her, these two end up in a marriage of convenience. Eros and Psyche have to fake being in love and pretend this marriage is real to everyone, but the actual execution of this was lackluster and underwhelming. I didn’t grow to care that much about Eros or Psyche, and the whole issue with his mother was so strange. I just couldn't understand why Eros didn’t tell his mother that he didn’t want to kill anyone anymore. But hey, if you love Katee Robert and neon gods, this is probably gonna work out better for you."

They're literally like walking talking cardboard cutouts that were having sex. Absolutely zero personality beyond ""I'm a monster"" and ""I'm a nice person who could love a monster"" respectively. Hoping the next Dark Olympus book will be better for me."
377,12,Electric Idol,Katee Robert,377,2022-01-08,Helen Power,5,"Quick Review: This book takes a popular romance novel trope of the marriage of convenience and puts a steamy and suspenseful new spin on it. Full Review:

This second installment in the Dark Olympus series is a standalone featuring Psyche and Eros and their epic love story. 



  The world that Katee Robert has created is fresh and unique. It has hints of the paranormal, what with Olympus being an impossible place to leave, but aside from this, none of the story has supernatural elements. Olympus resembles Manhattan, with the rich socialites and the political intrigue. The thirteen “gods” are in power in the city, and they each control different elements of trade and business. Psyche is the daughter of one of the thirteen, Demeter, and she has her public persona that is quite different from her personal one. She is a social media influencer, and is constantly seeking out the perfect photographs that look effortless while showing herself in the right light. I liked getting the peek of curtain for what the life of a social media influencer could really be like. Psyche deals with a lot of hateful comments on her posts because of her plus-size figure, and her carefully-perfected persona is both crafty and cunning. She has everything down to her favourite drink that she orders at bars selected under the knowledge that it will be under public scrutiny in the gossip magazines. 
  

  Aphrodite is one of the Thirteen who is arch nemesis to Demeter. Aphrodite’s son, Eros, does her bidding, whether it’s protecting her from enemies or killing those she views as a potential threat to her power. Because Aphrodite and Demeter despise each other, their children are barely acquaintances. But when Eros shows up to a party injured, Psyche, being a kind and selfless person, is compelled to help him. But of course, they both live in the public eye, and the paparazzi catch them leaving the bathroom together and assume that they’re “together”. Aphrodite is furious, and she tells Eros that she wants Psyche killed. But Eros, despite believing himself to be soulless, can’t bring himself to kill the one person who’s ever shown him kindness. *Insert swooning here*
  

  This book is intense and heavily plotted, but there are numerous sweet moments between Eros and Psyche. I’m not particularly familiar with Greek mythology, and though I was aware of the general story for the first book in this series (you have to be living under a rock not to have heard of Hades and Persephone), I didn’t know who Psyche or Eros was. Despite this ignorance, I loved Robert’s shallow socialites interpretation of this ancient mythology.

381,12,Electric Idol,Katee Robert,381,2022-02-21,✩ Yaz ✩,4,"4 - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️I don’t care if she deserves someone just as sweet as she is. I want her chained to me, and I’ll rip out the throat of anyone who thinks they can take her away.Electric Idol is a deliciously steamy reimagining of Psyche and Eros set in an urban fantastical setting ruled by Greek Gods.I have to applaud Katee Robert's skill on crafting a unique modern setting with Greek mythology so intricately. I'm always impressed with authors that add their own twists to popular myths and fairytales, it was a delight to return to the modern city of Olympus.To list a few tropes and elements you can expect to find in this book:— Marriage of Convenience— Plus-sized heroine— Tortured Morally Grey Hero— Reluctant Lovers— Political and Family Drama— One-bed Trope— Plenty of Spice— Power Plays — Greek Gods and Goddesses— StandaloneEros lived as his mother's knife for years, blood taints his own hands but that comes at no surprise when you are more monster than man.Psyche Dimitriou bumps into Eros at a party packed with paparazzi. caught in a ""not so"" compromising situation—Psyche becomes Aphrodite's target and the goddess is determined rid of her for tainting her and her son's image.And who else should end Psyche's life other than her most lethal weapon—her son Eros.I am Aphrodite’s knife. She tells me where to go, what revenge to exact, and I follow along like a fucked-up toy soldier.This book was a much better improvement than it's predecessor Neon Gods. The relationship between Psyche and Eros was developed splendidly. There was some tension and hesitation between the two and that's natural when a marriage starts off for each side's own motives. However as the story progresses, Psyche and Eros started reveal each layer to them.Aside from being a couple, they were both fantastic characters in their own right. I loved Psyche's vulnerability but also her confidence and intelligence. Eros falls under the torture hero category and I felt bad for what his mother groomed him to become. It was interesting to have his perspective on how he was battling with his past as his mother's assassin and the person he wants to be for Psyche as she made him realize there is more he wanted in this life.My only complaint is I was missing some more action scenes to keep me at the edge of my seat.If you're a fan of Greek Mythology especially the infamous tale of Psyche and Eros and sexy retellings, this book is a must!"
382,12,Electric Idol,Katee Robert,382,2022-01-31,Paloma,4,4.5 ⭐️🤩I was slightly nervous to read this bc I didnt love neon gods…but it was sooooooo good!!!! I’m a sucker for marriage of convenience & emotionally removed men 🤣 As someone who loves Greek mythology I think this was a refreshing retelling of Eros & Psyche’s story! Throughly enjoyed myself :) 
383,12,Electric Idol,Katee Robert,383,2022-04-11,abigail ❥ ~semi-hiatus~,5,"4.5 starsBuddy read with Aiyana 💗Unlike Neon Gods, I fell deep with Electric Idol. Psyche and Eros are endearing—the meet-cute was intimate and filled with desire and chemistry, you can't not help but like these two together. I don't know if it's a red flag, no—probably more of a weakness, but I always fall for the 'a little bit broken and morally grey' type of characters. I can't help it. Eros had me wishing I was Psyche.Psyche being plus-sized I absolutely loved. It was nice to have a plus-sized character never waver in their confidence and love of their body—I think this is something more plus-sized characters need in books as well as there needing to be even more of this type of representation (it's getting there).This book has me super excited for the next installment in the Dark Olympus series :)"
384,12,Electric Idol,Katee Robert,384,2022-09-04,Crystal's Bookish Life,2,Psyche abd Eros retelling. Bit boring honestly. Overall a pretty average book. Slightly better than the first. *I was provided an ARC in exchange for my honest review*
385,12,Electric Idol,Katee Robert,385,2022-05-28,~ a foray in fantasy ~,4,"I’ve been in kind of a reading slump mood, but this book fixed that."
386,12,Electric Idol,Katee Robert,386,2022-01-27,Redhead Haze,3,"Genre:  contemporary romance Tropes:  Greek myth retelling, forbidden romance, I was sent to kill you, forced proximity, fake marriage Series:  Dark Olympus #2Cliffhanger:  NoSpice:  4/5 🌶Rating:  3.25 ⭐ “What other way?”“You’re not going to like it.”He says it so flatly that I have to laugh. “Right. Because I like the idea of being murdered so much more.”Finally, he seems to steel himself and says, “Marry me.” I'm going to start by saying I liked the first book more. This one had the same vibe, but it was waaaay more annoying and boring at times. I did, however, liked Psyche and Eros enough. 》》The Plot《《 After Demeter tries to marry her daughter, Psyche, to the new Zeus, Afrodite takes it as an insult and sends her son, Eros, to kill the girl. But, for the first time in his life, Eros feels remorse and, instead of murdering her, he offers to marry her. And that's about the entire plot. They pretend to be madly in love so the public will be on their side in the hopes that Afrodite won't try to kill her anymore, which of course doesn't happen and (after uneventful pages of fake relationship) there's a final showdown. As long as you remember you're not reading this for the plot, it should be OK. “Be careful, Psyche. Eros is dangerous in the extreme.”“I know. He’s a monster. But after tonight, he’s my monster.”It was annoying as hell because at times it was very repetitive, like Eros insisting that he's a monster, saying that if he was a better man he would have left Psyche go, everyone else cautioning Psyche that Eris is dangerous and Hermes being excited about every little thing the Dimitriou sister do. I feel like it was exaggerated at the point of ridicule sometimes. For example: “Olympus is never dull with you and your sisters around.”“I could do with a little less excitement.” The excitement here was that Psyche asked Hermes to go out and post a picture, with her tagged as well, to trick people into thinking they went partying together. Excitement at its best, right? Anyway, I had to keep reminding myself nobody buys this for the plot. It was a cliché, albeit a fun one, with a predictable ending and no plot twists.》》Characters and Relationships《《 👩🏽 Psyche Dimitriou ""Psyche Dimitriou might actually be what passes for a unicorn in Olympus—a good person."" If there's something I loved here, it was the plus size representation of female MCs, because they are usually in the standard description of beauty. So Psyche being portrayed as such was refreshing. She was also pretty smart and determined and she ended up solving things by herself, so cheers to women who know how to handle life. 🧑🏼 Eros Ambrosia ""I am Aphrodite’s knife. She tells me where to go, what revenge to exact, and I follow along like a fucked-up toy soldier. My input is never asked for and sure as fuck never heeded."" Pretty much the classic bad boy every other character knows to avoid. Until he falls hard for the good girl and becomes good just for her sake. 👩🏽🧑🏼 Psyche and Eros “I was under the impression you wanted me out of my clothes.”“Pass.” “Everyone else does.”“Am I supposed to feel sorry for you? Or are you bragging? Please be clear so I can adjust my reaction accordingly.”He bursts out laughing. “Clever.” They kind of had that insta-love I'm not exactly a fan of, but the banter was pretty good. The spice scenes were on point too and, if Hades had a kink for the show, Eros has a fascination with mirrors so at least that wasn't boring. I liked that despite the bad boy - good girl style of the romance, it definitely wasn't a toxic one like some other books portrayed it and at least that is worth appreciating. 👩🏼👩🏽 Persephone and Psyche “That’s a bit shortsighted.”I give Persephone a look. “Says the woman who ran away from Zeus and hooked up with the boogeyman of Olympus. Let’s not cast stones.”My sister seems entirely unconvinced. “Hades didn’t earn his reputation. Eros has.” I loved that Persephone and Hades appeared here as well and, of course, just like in the first book, I liked the sisterly bond between the girls. But Eurydice was completely absent and Calipso did her own thing (I would like more details about her power marriage!!!), so the proper bond we got to see was between these two. “You must realize who I have in my corner. If you do something to me, Persephone will rip you into a million pieces, and Hades will stand by to ensure no one stops her from doing it.” I also loved the references and the few scenes where Hades and Persephone were brought up, because I don't know about you, but I always get duper excited when I see old characters mentioned. 👩🏿 Hermes  ""The woman is 90 percent cat; she comes and goes when she feels like it and helps herself to my food and booze regardless of whether I’m in the house to offer it or not. It’s annoying and weirdly endearing in a way no one but Hermes could pull off."" She's still my favorite character and I'm still waiting for a book about her. I'm sure that one won't be boring. And, if we're talking about side characters, Helen and Eris, Zeus' sisters and Eros' friends were also cool and I'm looking forward to the 3rd book, which will be about Helen. 》》Conclusion《《 It definitely wasn't as good as the first one, but I still kind of enjoy it and I'm definitely going to read the third one when it will be out. There are enough ups and downs to make it impossible to predict whether someone might love or hate this but, in the end, it's all about choosing our own poison, right? “Look at us. Beauty and her Beast. Happily ever after and everything. Maybe fairy tales do exist.”“You’re much prettier than the Beast ever was.”He gives a rough laugh. “And yet much more of a beast than he could ever be.”“I don’t care. Beast, monster, man, it doesn’t matter to me. You’re mine, Eros Ambrosia.” I tilt my head up and brush a kiss over his lips. “And I’m yours.”"
387,12,Electric Idol,Katee Robert,387,2021-12-09,Jenn (The Book Refuge),5,"*Thank you to the author and Edelweiss for an eARC of this book.*I am so thrilled to be reviewing Electric Idol by Katee Robert. I am a huge fan of Katee and how she pushes the envelope and is always trying something new while also giving me her trademark steam and thrilling romance.Eros and Psyche are in a pickle when we begin this book and things only get crazier from there. This sweet, luscious woman is just being kind ends up getting on the wrong side of Aphrodite. Who now wants her son to unalive Psyche. But Eros doesn't want to be wielded like a weapon this time and certainly not to end this woman's life. So he offers the only help he can. A hasty marriage with him. Literally her assassin will become her savior. Of course it can be a chaste, in name only situation… but for how long. When they are drawn so strongly towards each other?Well.. It's a romance, so let that be your answer, but the road to HEA won't be smooth. As it never is on Olympus.I can not wait to see what comes next in this series and I am so happy Katee has at least 6 coming in total for this series.5/5 Stars"
388,12,Electric Idol,Katee Robert,388,2022-02-08,Frédérique,5,I loved Neon Gods so so much!! But I never thought I would enjoy Electric Idol so much more! The storyline wasn't too fast-paced although the story happens on a couple of days. I truly enjoyed reading their story.Their chemistry and banter make their relationship so much better. I love it when the male love interest is sent to kill the MC but decides to save her instead!! Psyche is truly the star of the story. We stan a selfless plus size queen. All I can say is that you don't wanna miss on reading Electric Idol because it is a fantastic story!!
389,12,Electric Idol,Katee Robert,389,2022-03-09,h o l l i s ,2,"Even though I'm rating this the same as book one, the bits I liked and disliked are very different. Which is why it shakes out the same.I had such a hard time understanding the worldbuilding when this series started. And I wonder if maybe I wasn't alone in that and it somehow got back to the author. Because things finally solidified for me with how things were presented and expanded on in this sequel. Which meant I spent a lot less time confused and perplexed and instead I was able to just enjoy (ish) the ride.Once again, though, if I didn't stare too hard at the way time passed (or didn't) and how in little to no time the romance escalated to stratospheric levels.. I was onboard. I enjoyed the chemistry between these two a lot more than the preceding book. Who doesn't love a marriage of convenience trope when paired up with forced proximity -- lots of people, I'm sure, but I do. However.. it was too fast. But I think the pressure was put on that element to distract you from how there was really only one minor plot point to the whole story and even that is basically shelved, or at least unrealized, until the last 30% or so. Also the whole catalyst for the romance.. again, don't look too hard at it or it'll all tumble down like a house of cards.I did, however, enjoy spending time with some of the secondary characters and really like what has been set up for.. book four? Five? Who knows. I won't spoil it but if you've read this you likely know what set up I mean. But I'm equally as keen for the next book based on the synopsis. Robert keeps hooking me with her pairings.But as for this one? I did like this couple. Psyche felt more authentic and I really enjoyed how Eros was able to become a person again. Because of that I think they'll stand out more than Hades and Persephone as time goes on, too. Maybe I should even actually award this one three stars. I probably won't but they might deserve it.I do have one more complaint though : what the hell is the title referencing? I'm so lost. I'm clearly missing something or it was just plucked out of a title generator. Someone throw me a hint.2.5 stars---This review can also be found at A Take From Two Cities."
390,13,The Bodyguard,Katherine Center,390,2022-02-18,Helen Hoang,5,"THIS BOOK WAS SO FUN!!! I lost count of how many times I laughed while reading. It was like a spoonful of sugar, or better yet, pure sunshine. I would not be surprised at all if it was immediately adapted to film, starring juggernaut actors like, say, Ryan Reynolds. A perfect feel-good romcom.Readers of mine might expect a certain amount of steam since I’m recommending this, but I’d categorize this as a non-pants-feeling type of book, so you can buddy read this with your virgin great aunt and not worry about giving her a heart attack."
391,13,The Bodyguard,Katherine Center,391,2021-11-22,Katherine Center,5,"Well. You know. I *wrote* this book. So. I probably shouldn't be reviewing it??? But also—how can I resist? I have read it, after all. Many times. And, for me, it's just pure sunshine. So . . . five totally unbiased stars! 😂"
392,13,The Bodyguard,Katherine Center,392,2022-08-05,Haley pham,4,"4.5 stars!!! This book had everything I love in a romance: tiny and thoughtful displays of love, and little details that come back around later to make a well rounded story. No spice in this one! Not sure if I’ll change this to 5 stars later but it’s a possibility! "
393,13,The Bodyguard,Katherine Center,393,2023-03-18,Nilufer Ozmekik,4,"Oh hell no! This is the first time I’m giving a new Katherine Center book less than five stars! But hear me out my friends: this book could be easily adapted into Netflix romcom screenplay and with the best cast choices, it could be a hit. So I applied my formula when I read a little unreliable story and I imagined it as a movie script and started to make my own cast list. They may cast three Emmas ( Roberts- Stone- Watson) for the leading woman/executive protection agent/ bodyguard Hannah Brooks( my choice for leading lady who play Hannah is Awkwafina : because I’m dying to see this amazing actress in a romcom) and Jack Stapleton: broken hearted, sweet, caring, box office actor should be played by Chrises ( Hemsworth- Pine- Evans, I’m skipping Pratt! and my personal choice is always Evans who wears white knitted sweater best than any human being) The plot line of this story is a little far fetched: an ambitious, workaholic exe. protection agent who lately buried her mother and dumped by her coworker- extra douche boyfriend, is hired by the production company to protect the well being of their number one asset: their leading actor Jack Stapleton who lost his brother three years ago, laying low, coming back to his hometown Austin to take care of her mother who suffers from cancer. But he has a woman stalker who has creative ways to disturb him. He doesn’t want his family worry about his situation and Hannah doesn’t want him out of sight so she reluctantly makes a deal to act like a girlfriend in front of Jack’s family! But you may guess the rest: both of them fell for each other but Hannah deals with her own insecurities and baggage about her family. Jack still suffers from guilt about losing his brother, nightmares, estrangement with his big brother. I found the plot with lots of cliches. At some parts I couldn’t even connect with Hannah. But when we see some parts about her past and the drama about her family, I started resonating with her. On the other hand: Jack of Texan sweetheart: he was amazing from the beginning. As supporting characters: Jack’s family is amazing. I always enjoy the books or movie scripts about a lonely woman who gets adopted by big and lovely family of hero like Bullock’s While you were sleeping.  On the other hand : agent team gave me creeps: especially Robby and so called best friend Taylor were one dimensional extra mean people without any backbone. Glenn’s full name reminds me of high quality bourbon brand and I liked his sadistic ways to torture his team members ( Bob Odenkirk played his role in my head) and quick witted Kelly was my one of my favorites( I casted Kate McKinnon and I loved her character more)  Overall: sweet, pop corn book, a little different from the previous works of the author: still entertaining, enjoyable. For the love of Jack : I rounded my 3.5 stars to 4 Texan, Dolly Patron’s I will always love you stars!

394,13,The Bodyguard,Katherine Center,394,2022-12-01,Yun,4,"Ah, this was the feelgood, fun, cheesy romcom I didn't know I needed!(In the interest of total transparency, I want to confess I picked this book up for no reason other than it has the same name as one of my favorite movies ever—you know, the one with Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner. So yeah, if you write a book called The Bodyguard, I will read it, is what I'm trying to say. Right, back to the topic at hand.)Hannah is going through a heartbreaking time. Her mom just passed away and her boyfriend dumps her immediately after the funeral. What's an asskicking girl supposed to do but get lost in her job to take the edge off the pain? Good thing she's an Executive Protection Agent (fancy name for a bodyguard), and protecting her latest client, the swoonworthy movie star Jack Stapleton, is sure to take her mind off her life... unless she falls for him, which she definitely won't do.In case it's not clear, this isn't a story you take too seriously. It's more of a lighthearted, sweet, happy romance with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments. I smiled so much through the whole thing, my cheeks felt a little sore afterwards. At times, it does cross over to the sappy side, at least for me. But it didn't happen too often and the funny scenes helped to balance it out.I know romance readers can be a bit divided on the inclusion of explicit sex scenes, of which this book has none. For me, I don't generally prefer that because those stories tend to lack steam and feel unrealistic to me. But I didn't think so here. In fact, this story wasn't missing anything by not including those scenes. There's a permeating tone of lightheartedness and charm to the whole thing, and the exclusion of those scenes just made sense.I don't want to oversell how happy and fun this story was, because there were definitely some emotionally heavy moments that had me tearing up and reaching for my tissue box. But overall, this was such a pleasant diversion from real life. I come out of it feeling warm and comforted all over, and I'm honestly not ready to let that feeling go just yet. This was a pick for my Book of the Month box. Get your first book for $5 here."
395,13,The Bodyguard,Katherine Center,395,2022-03-20,jessica,3,"i think this was a little too ‘romcom’ for me, personally.i found most of the attempts at being charming and funny actually feeling juvenile and awkward. i dunno. its just a little too over the top for what i was wanting and expecting. i will say that the gender roles in this are refreshing. it was so interesting to have the female MC be the bodyguard and protect the guy. i think the dynamic itself actually worked out well. its just a shame that i didnt think any of the characters acted like fully grown adults. i also dont think it helps that this is a slow burn romance, which would have worked really well if this had a more serious and realistic tone. but because its supposed to be upbeat and light, it definitely needed some of that banter and tension to balance it out. so not having any sort of romance show up until the 85% mark is just too late to make a difference. so this didnt quite work out for me. but based on other reviews, im definitely in the minority. so if you enjoy the fake dating trope, then this is one to add to your TBR. thanks for the ARC, st. martins press.↠ 3 stars"
396,13,The Bodyguard,Katherine Center,396,2022-08-05,Matilda ,1,"1 star 💫i’m feeling like the biggest hater right now because there truly was nothing i enjoyed about this book.actually, i knew i would hate this book when i read the very first line—MY MOTHER’S DYING wish was for me to take a vacation.that is the most random “dying wish” i have ever heard of. yanno what’s funnier? she chose toledo, ohio as her destination.who in their right mind would vacation in ohio? cause nothing says vacation like vast fields of nothingness (sorry ohioans, idk how this turned into a “why ohio kinda sucks” review)
characters
hannah (h) is allegedly this tough bodyguard that has a 2nd degree black belt in jiu jitsu, yet screams and freaks out when a cow licks her arm.she has ZERO backbone and allows her ex, her boss and her best friend to walk all over her.her ex literally told her to her face that jack (H) would never be her girlfriend because “look at hannah compared to jack’s ex”—
“Just look! Nobody in a million years will ever possibly believe that this person, right here, bested the legendary Kennedy Monroe to become Jack Stapleton’s girlfriend.”
and she did/said nothing. in my mind, she’s standing exactly like this 🧍‍♀️jack just existed. he was your typical ‘actor hero’ that spoke but said nothing at all. you may notice that i refer to him as jake a few times in this review. his personality resembled stale, white bread so why should bother calling him jack when jake sounds better?anywho, jake literally screamed at hannah because she walked into this very dangerous river and nearly drowned. why? because she didn’t KNOW the river was dangerous 😱 how the fuck is she supposed to know that when you never told her and she doesn’t live in the area ohmygod—
“Nobody’s supposed to do that! Don’t you know how many people drown in that river every year?” “Why would I know that?” “Everybody knows that! Never swim in the Brazos.”who’s everyone? she’s from houston, not rural texas 🫥jack was named “sexist man alive” (twice), yet he had as much sex appeal as danny devito
the romance
non-existent to the point there’s not even anything NEGATIVE to say. the faking dating trope was pointless because they fake-dated for like a few days? it’s unclear really the whole reason hannah and jake fake dated is because jake’s mom was diagnosed with cancer and was having surgery to remove the tumor. jack didn’t want to cause unnecessary stress during that time, so he pretended like hannah was his girlfriend and not his bodyguard. hannah became his bodyguard because he was being stalked and his family didn’t know about itthe romance consisted of jake saying extremely backhanded things to hannah. i suppose the author thought i would find it romantic when jake told his brother that hannah isn’t a ‘hollywood bimbo’ like his brother tried to say 🤠
“Have you seen my other girlfriends? Have you seen Kennedy Monroe? She’s nothing like any of them. She’s short. Her teeth are crooked. She barely wears any makeup. She doesn’t self-tan, wear extensions, or dye her hair. She’s a totally plain, unremarkable person. She’s the epitome of ordinary.”
i would absolutely adore being referred to as the epitome of ordinary, an idiot, and plain by a man 😍 i just love when men point out your insecurities and say they ‘like them’, babes, no one asked ✋🏻
the writing
positively traumatic. idk if you guys watched the persuasion movie with dakota johnson but you know all the horrible 4th wall breaks? this book had the same energy. like why is hannah speaking directly to me— HAVE I EXPLAINED what I do for a living? I usually try to put that off as long as possible. Because once you know—once I actually name the profession—you’ll make a long list of assumptions about me … and all of them will be wrong.uhhh…okay? 👁👁it’s hilarious because for the first chapter i was 100% convinced i was reading a completely different book than the one the blurb described. i had to reverse search hannah’s name to ensure my app didn’t glitch and give me the wrong book 🤡
plot
very boring and lackluster to be honestnow, i’m about to spoil the plot and jake’s stalker so don’t continue reading if you don’t wanna know. then again, if you’re at this point of the review, would you even want to read this??spoiler belowat the end of the book, we discover jake’s stalker wasn’t a woman who knitted jake’s sweaters of his face, like they originally thought. it was a guy that was mad his wife left him for jake...because she was obsessed with him.the stalker breaks into jake’s home, ties him up, holds him at gunpoint, & shoots and grazes hannah in the head. yet, in the epilogue it’s revealed he was released from prison within 5 years and opened his own business building birdhouses…HE ALMOST KILLED HANNAH AND GETS A SLAP ON THE WRIST??? IN TEXAS??? BITCH PLEASE WHAHAHAHAHi’m glad this book ended on a comedically bad note because nothing was good about this till that wonderful part 😊"
397,13,The Bodyguard,Katherine Center,397,2022-09-26,MarilynW,4,"The Bodyguard by Katherine CenterPetite, ordinary, maybe stumpy legged, Hannah Brooks works as an Executive Protection Agent. Life was hard growing up and Hannah has trust issues. She learned that no one would take care of her so she had to take care of herself. And now she makes a living taking care of others. She is obsessed with working, she always wants to be on the job. She wants no downtime, never takes vacation, and is considered boring by the guy who just dumped her. Worse yet is that he told her she is a lousy kisser. Dating two years and now he tells her!Hannah is always fighting self esteem issues so her ex boyfriend's pronouncement and dumping doesn't help her. She needs to work, now! Her sadistic boss likes to put his employees in the most uncomfortable positions for whatever is going on in their lives. So when a full team job pops up, he assigns Hannah to be the girlfriend of a world famous hunk of an actor, Jack Stapleton, who is dealing with a stalker and personal issues. Jack doesn't want his family to worry, especially his mother, so that's why he doesn't want them to know that he has been assigned a bodyguard. But now Hannah can't wear her ""work suit"" outfits and sturdy shoes and instead, must wear sundresses and sandals and sleep in Jack's room. You'd think wealthy, famous, Jack would be a jerk, narcissist, someone with no time for the regular people of the world. But instead, he's friendly, silly, funny, maybe even a bit dorky, and Hannah has to fight to remember he's acting, he's an actor, he's pretending to like her, this is not real. Hannah adores Jack's family, they are the family she always wished she had, especially Jack's mother, who obviously thinks Hannah is good for her son. She is falling fast and hard for something that isn't real but Hannah is loving her time with Jack and his family, on the family ranch. I adore this story, Jack, and his family. Hannah is pretty internally neurotic for a bodyguard but what do I know, really, I've never met a bodyguard. She sees that there is a possibility for life outside of her armor of her constant work but this life and man that she is falling for will be gone once this job it over. The Bodyguard is a fun story of people who enjoy being around each other and with side helpings of dysfunctional co-workers. Hannah fits right in with her dysfunctional co-workers but sees that isn't where she really wants to be, anymore. Pub July 19th 2022Thank you to St. Martin's Press and NetGalley for this ARC."
398,13,The Bodyguard,Katherine Center,398,2022-07-27,Val ⚓️ Shameless Handmaiden ⚓️,3,"3 StarsTiming really is everything, isn't it? And sadly, the timing was not great for me here. In fact, I actually feel bad for this book. How you say? By doing it the disservice of reading it on the direct heels of what might probably be my favorite book of the reading year. Looking back, I should have followed that read up with a completely different genre rather than something so similar in tone and nature. As such, this entire read felt lacking in comparison to its predecessor, no matter how valiantly I attempted to disassociate the two books. That said, ignore this review completely. I mean, I will still throw some remarks down yonder to express my thoughts on this thing, but seriously...this book is probably way better than my experience with it and I'm definitely in the minority in not loving it. So I will be brief. In short, I struggled to connect with the characters here. Even at the end of the story, I felt like I didn't really know any of them at all. And I should have. Because a character like Hannah, with her background and experiences, is right up my alley. Instead, she felt like a Hallmark movie character and I just felt zero connection to her and Jack's story. Also, it should be noted that this is my fourth Katherine Center book. I loved the first two I read and the third was WAY too sweet and slapstick for me. Well, this one leaned more in that direction. And while I appreciate the lightness and positivity with which Center writes her stories, depending on my mood, those sentiments just don't always land for me. What can I say, I am a cynic. But anyway, I digress. While this didn't blow me away, I still liked it well enough. And I know that Center's writing and storytelling can work for me in the very best way. So moving forward, I will just make sure I'm in the mood for her brand of sugary romcom before diving into her next release. Because I really want to like them and know that it's possible."
399,13,The Bodyguard,Katherine Center,399,2023-03-30,Susan's Reviews,5,"That long-awaited kissing scene was SPECTACULAR!!!Audio book review: I really loved reading the actual book, so I jumped at the chance to listen to the audio version when it came out. I was not disappointed: the narration by Patti Murin was top notch and Center's tongue in cheek, let's-laugh-at-life's-inevitable-foibles style translates beautifully to the spoken (i.e., audible) word!The final chapter tied everything up beautifully in Center's uniquely quirky way, which never fails to leave a crooked smile on my face. I love this author's ""realistic positivity"" - if these two elements can truly co-exist! My thanks, once again, to the fabulous author (one of my top ten Go-To authors), Katherine Center, her publisher, MacMillan Audio, and NetGalley for an ARC of this audiobook in exchange for an honest review. (NB: I had to tag this on to my existing GR review, because that's how GR rolls....!)Original Review posted on November 24, 2021:The Anatomy of a Love Story: the Prequel, the Main Event, and the rollicking Epilogue... Katherine Center has delivered the full riotous, awww-worthy package!STAR WARS - MOVE OVER! (jk!)  Okay, so my tendency to hyperbolize is very apparent here, but we do see Hannah emerge from the chrysalis that she has been frozen in ever since her early childhood - after her father left and her mother retreated into drugs and alcohol to escape the wreckage of her life.Hannah has no room for romance: she stays busy so that she doesn't have time to dwell on how empty - how devoid - her life is of that four letter word: LOVE (along with companionship and true friends.)Hell literally breaks loose in the first chapters of this novel. My advice? Hold on tight because you are in for a very bumpy - and laugh filled! - ride: Hannah Brooks and Jack Stapleton are a match made in.... well, TEXAS! I roared with laughter as these two irrepressible lunatics were forced to masquerade as lovers while staying at the Stapleton family ranch - in an effort to pull the wool over the eyes of Jack's seriously ill mother. I loved the entire Stapleton clan, as well as the corral of rescued circus horses. There were so many fascinating side stories that you never had time to catch your breath or feel bored.At some point, the lines got blurred and these two madcaps often forgot that the relationship wasn't real.Meryl Streep makes a cameo appearance, along with a set of steak knives and a precocious four year old!And that BIG KISSING SCENE..... IT WAS SO WORTH THE WAIT!!! I truly needed this wonderful, hilarious, hopelessly romantic bird's eye view of the epic love story between a much stalked and beleaguered movie star and his pint-sized bodyguard. I loved it and never wanted their story to end. Five out of five well-deserved stars! Highly, highly recommended if you need a good laugh.... or ten![My thanks to the author, publisher and NetGalley for an ARC of this wonderful novel in exchange for an honest review.

400,13,The Bodyguard,Katherine Center,400,2022-08-31,Margaret M - Semi hiatus - So much catching up to do,5,"My head says 4 stars but my body is less guarded !!! So heart wins this time. Was this hot? Did temperatures rise?? Yes in parts and to 4.5 but overall a perfectly temperature-controlled story that is irresistibly charming, predictably satisfying and cheerfully entertaining. The pace was constant, the sexual content moderate to low, the chemistry was sizzling, and the story was delightful and my heart rate – well brisk but only at times.A perfect holiday read. A book for any time.The Plot Following the death of her mother Hannah is ordered to take compassionate leave by her normally dispassionate boss. A boss who sees her, like many others as someone who finds relaxing difficult, is an obsessive work alcoholic, and a woman not interested in her own appearance or anyone’s opinion of her. Things do however get worse with an unceremonious dumping by work colleague boyfriend at such a difficult time in her life. Things have gone as bad they can in every direction especially when Hannah's best friend turns out to be the reason why their relationship ended.However, what would be a to-die-for assignment for most. To become bodyguard for Hollywood actor Jack Stapleton, Hannah is not interested and only accepts the assignment with the promise of the coveted London position, that will give her the chance to rebuild her life away from her former boyfriend and the office they shared.Well you can probably predict what happens from here. Where attraction is mental before its physical as both fall in love with the person first. Cosy, romantic and the stuff of fairy tales !!!Review and Comments Romance is not my favourite genre but I do love a great everyday romantic story that feels real and when it comes to scoring I try to rate a book in the context of the genre it was written for and the people it was designed to appeal to. So if an author can write a romantic story that I loved reading, is not too mushy, unnecessarily vulgar, is uplifting, and limits the eye rolls usually a result of cheesy comments then it’s getting 4-5 stars. The Bodyguard had everything I wanted and didn’t want in a romantic novel, hence rounding up to the 5 stars- A decent story line that is not to be taken seriously - Likeable characters - Not too sappy or cheesy - The chemistry believable - Easy to read on the beach so I can watch the world go by - A feel good book that is uplifting, humorous and entertaining - My favourite romance story - falling for the person before the physical side is discoveredHighly recommended. Thank you to my GR friends who recommended to me."
401,13,The Bodyguard,Katherine Center,401,2022-07-11,Meredith (Slowly Catching Up),4,"The premise had me rolling my eyes, but the characters made me smile!The Bodyguard is a sweet and fun romance about a female bodyguard assigned to protect a very handsome movie star.Hannah Brooks is an Executive Protection Agent--in simplified terms, she is a bodyguard. Hannah loves her job, but when she is assigned to work on the detail of movie star Jack Stapelton, she is less than enthused. Not only does she have to be his bodyguard, but she also has to pretend to be his girlfriend. Narrated by Hannah, I loved her character and her inner dialogue. She is smart and witty, and she takes her job seriously. One of my favorite scenes was when she demonstrated her skills to Jack. Jack is also likable, and I loved the banter between Hannah and Jack. It's easy to root for them.Outside of Hannah’s profession, the plot is a little predictable, but Hannah, Jack, and the quirky cast of side characters made up for that. I read this while on vacation, and The Bodyguard was the perfect, light-hearted read I needed. It’s feel-good fun with warm-hearted characters, witty banter, and, of course, romance. I received an ARC of this book from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review."

403,13,The Bodyguard,Katherine Center,403,2022-07-19,JanB ,5,"Available now!I adored this book! This was the right book at the right time. A feel-good story to warm my heart! Hannah is going through turmoil and recent losses in her personal life which has left her unmoored and unsure of what to do next. She works as a bodyguard, and hopes to get an overseas assignment, when she is assigned to protect the famous actor, Jack Stapleton, right in her own hometown. Jack has a stalker and is in town to visit his family. He casts a skeptical eye toward Hannah, doubting her ability to protect him,  but she soon sets him straight in an amusing display of her skills.  His one request? Jack doesn’t want his family to know about the stalker and his need for a bodyguard, so Hannah must pose as his girlfriend.  So, OK, we’ve all seen the Hallmark movies and read the books, so we know where this is going. But, as I’ve often said, it’s more about the journey in these stories and this one was top notch! I absolutely loved the witty banter, and the often-amusing thoughts of Hannah. Jack is swoon-worthy and I fell in love with his family. But it is not all fluff, as there are some serious subjects to be explored. This is what I like to call a lighter read with substance, and the perfect feel-good book when you need to put a smile on your face. I love that this is a closed-door romance, written with no agendas or social messages. A straightforward story to entertain was a breath of fresh air! It was pure fun and I was sorry when it came to an end.I rate according to genre and how a book made me feel, so an easy 5 stars! This was a buddy read with Marialyce and for both of us was the right book at the right time. Do check out her review.  ·      I received both the digital and audio review copies via NetgGalley. The narrator of the audio was excellent. All opinions are my own.·      Publishing date July 19, 2022 by SMP"
404,13,The Bodyguard,Katherine Center,404,2022-07-14,Melissa (Hiatus for Work-Will Pop In When I Can)),4,"4.5 starsThis is such a sweet, heartwarming, and uplifting book. Is it a bit sappy and predictable, and are the characters all a bit too perfect? Yes, but that doesn't detract from the book for me at all. If you're looking for a delightfully funny yet poignant book, then look no further than Center's latest.Hannah Brooks is a protection agent, otherwise known as a bodyguard. She may look petite and unassuming, but she can bring a large man down before he knows what's hit him. She is reluctantly assigned to protect movie star Jack Stapleton while he is in Houston visiting his family. He's just the kind of vapid, self-absorbed person she dislikes, and now she has to pretend to be his girlfriend. To her surprise, she falls for his family, and for Jack as well. This book is just an utter joy to read. I listened to it as an audiobook and the narrator, Patti Murin, does a fantastic job of giving Hannah a voice and spirit. I urge you to pick this one up today, you'll be glad you did.I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book, all opinions are my own. "
405,13,The Bodyguard,Katherine Center,405,2022-08-30,Dorie  - Cats&Books :) ,4,"***HAPPY PUBLICATION DAY TO THIS FUN BOOK***THIS WAS JUST THE BOOK I NEEDED RIGHT NOW!! After several disappointing thrillers, I was so happy to find myself laughing within an hour after starting this book!! It’s almost impossible not to!! This book just made me feel good!!Hannah Brooks is an Executive Protective Agent, more commonly known as a bodyguard. But what Hannah and those in her agency do is a much more skilled job. They need to stay close to their clients without being noticed – harder than it sounds as we’ll see.Hannah has had a terrible week, her mother just passed away and her boyfriend has dumped her!! As if that isn’t enough, her boss has forced her to take time off, the last thing that she wants to do is sit around and JUST THINK!! Finally her boss Glenn calls her into work with a new assignment. Hannah can’t wait to get out of Texas. BUT WAIT, SHE CAN’T BELIEVE IT, HER NEXT ASSIGNMENT IS RIGHT HERE IN HOUSTON, THE TOWN SHE MOST WANTS TO LEAVE BEHIND. Then the details come out. She is assigned to protect Jack Stapleton, a Hollywood hunk that is sure to be spotted back in his hometown. He is back to be close to his mom who is having cancer surgery – but he has to be invisible or he could bring hoards of adoring fans and nutters to the family ranch, endangering not only himself but his family. Here’s where Hannah comes in, but her job becomes harder when Jack tells her that she has to pose as his girlfriend or his mom will be upset that he is ever in any danger – they can’t know she’s a bodyguard.I won’t spoil this terrific read for you by giving away any more of the plot.Yes there were parts that were hard to believe, but actors are just people after all, even if they are incredibly handsome. As it turns out he’s also tenderly sweet, funny and a downright nice guy.I enjoyed every minute of this book and the ending was FROSTING ON THE CAKE!! I don’t read rom-coms but this is more than that. It’s about believing in yourself, allowing yourself to love and be loved and appreciating what you have to offer to the world. We can’t all be bodyguards like Hannah – but I think we all have something we can offer to others. A simple thing like a note to an ill neighbor, an extra pat on the back to an employee, just being kind to another is a gift.I highly recommend this novel to anyone who wants to feel good, laugh out loud and remember the joy of reading something that makes us feel good.I received an ARC of this novel from the publisher through Edelweiss.#SMP INFLUENCER"

This book was cute and funny, and I found the romance to be sweet. The ending was so great, and I loved it so much. I was kindly provided an e-copy of this book by the publisher (St. Martin's Press) or author (Katherine Center) via NetGalley, so I can give an honest review about how I feel about this book. I want to send a big Thank you to them for that."
407,13,The Bodyguard,Katherine Center,407,2022-07-19,Jayme,4,"Hannah Brooks looks like a sweet, petite kindergarten teacher- but she is actually a competent bodyguard who could kill you with a wine bottle opener or a dinner napkin, if she had to. And, she never gets attached to her assignments. So, nobody would be better for protecting mega movie star Jack Stapleton from his stalker, when he needs a bodyguard who could pass as his girlfriend so he can return home to see his mom through Cancer treatments. Until, Jack and his family start to fall in love with Hannah-and she starts to feel something she has never felt too. But, how could that be? And, what’s a girl to do now! If you have enjoyed Katherine Center’s books in the past, you will adore this one too! You will recognize the cadence of her characters voices, their love of the term “Fair Enough” and of course, there is always joyful dancing 💃🏻 dancing 🕺🏻! But, despite these givens, this is a “breath of fresh air” story, that will have you smiling, laughing and maybe even tearing up, a time or two! There IS chemistry between our leads, but the door remains closed, after the clothes get shed, so it’s pretty PG-but I enjoyed their witty banter, and watching their relationship evolve, and I think you will too! AVAILABLE NOW!!❤️A buddy read with DeAnn and Marilyn-we had fun casting the parts for our leading lady and leading man! Thank You to St. Martin’s Press for the early gifted copy! It was my pleasure to offer a candid review!"
408,13,The Bodyguard,Katherine Center,408,2022-08-13,Gabby,4,"This was so cute, and the perfect summer rom com. I listened to this audiobook over two weeks, which I never usually do, but every time I listened to it, it made me smile. I love that she is hired as his body guard, and that he’s an actor, but I love that to disguise the fact that she’s his body guard and not raise any flags, she has to pretend to be his fake girlfriend. I’m a SUCKER for the fake dating trope, and this one was so cute! I adored Jack so hard, and he’s been through so much, my heart hurt for him at times. Parts of this book has me genuinely cracking up and laughing out loud which rarely happens for me these days, I especially loved the scene of him explaining to her how actors cry on demand and kind of ‘ruining’ the movie magic for her. It was so great. The end of this book got a little cheesy and I thought the ending was alright, it was a little cringe-y at the end, but otherwise this was a really fun and adorable read with great characters! :) it’s probably my favorite book from this author so far!"

I have read 2 of Katherine Centers previous novels and while I enjoyed them, this one blew those 2 books out of the water, by far! I loved this one!! Bodyguard, Hannah, meets superstar, Jack Stapleton. The relationship between Jack and Hannah melted my heart, it was so fun and playful! Their interactions felts genuine. They were both going dealing with difficult situations in their lives and they helped heal each other and it was the sweetest thing. I feel in love with Doc and Connie too, and found myself dreaming of being on the ranch in Texas hanging out with them. This was the perfect read and exactly what I needed right now. This book left me smiling!! Highly recommend this one!Thank you Net Galley and St. Martin’s Press for an ARC in return for my honest review."
412,13,The Bodyguard,Katherine Center,412,2022-01-09,Kaceey,4,"A tad predictable but didn’t take away from my enjoyment one little bit!Hannah Brooks works for a private security firm as an Executive Protection Agent. More commonly referred to as a bodyguard. No, she’s not your typical, hulking figure at six feet plus. Far from it, Hannah is an inch or two over five feet. Rather cute, completely unsuspecting. But make no mistake…looks are deceiving. She is an expert in martial arts and will gladly leave you broken in a puddle of mud if need be.After the death of her mother and break up with her boyfriend (who just happens to also work for the firm), Hanna is re-focusing her energy hoping to get back to work and find some peace of mind. Her latest assignment might be the perfect ticket.Jack Stapleton is a Hollywood A-lister here in Houston for a family obligation. Hannah is assigned to his case as the primary agent and must keep Jack in sight at all times. And it doesn’t hurt that he’s drop-dead gorgeous.🤩But quickly Hannah finds herself so tangled up in it all, she isn’t sure what’s real and what’s an act.I loved Hannah’s inner voice. Strong yet vulnerable. She was relentlessly stepped on by a lot of the other characters – maybe a bit too much at times. But through it all, always held her head up proudly no matter what and showed an inner strength we all want and need.I adore Katherine Center’s books. Always guaranteed a fun rom-com that will demonstrate strength. Combined with equal amounts of love and laughter to keep me smiling along the wayA buddy read with Susanne.Posted to: https://books-are-a-girls-best-friend...Thank you to NetGalley and St. Martin’s Press."
413,13,The Bodyguard,Katherine Center,413,2022-07-19,Kay ☼,5,"My second Katherine Center rom-com is a WOWZA, you guys!💞✨She may be small, but Hannah Brooks is a feisty bodyguard. Heartbroken (sort of) and losing her mother, Hannah wants to escape far away with assignments in London or Seoul. Instead, her boss assigned her to a Hollywood superstar, Jack Stapleton from a deranged stalker. She so does not want this gig. To top it off, Jack's mother is ill and he is visiting her at the ranch in Katy, Texas outside of Houston. So as not to alarm his mom that his life is in danger, Hannah has to pretend to be his girlfriend!I know, I know... such cliche, but believe me, these two are adorable! There are so many laugh-out-loud moments. Their banters are fun, her job is interesting, and the secondary characters like her boss, coworkers, and Jack's family are so charming. My only small complaint is the last few chapters. I wish it ended just a little bit before. Yes, it's very predictable but would you really want a twist at the end? NOOO. Fake dating, forbidden relationship (Hannah takes her job seriously), close proximity, and a clean romance. The Bodyguard no doubt will be a smashing hit! I highly recommend the audiobook. Patti Murin's narration is phenomenal. Love her! 🎧💖Thank you Macmillan Audio and Netgalley for my DRC.Available July 19, 2022!"
414,13,The Bodyguard,Katherine Center,414,2022-07-17,Kat *will catch up soon!*,4,"Hannah Brooks is an Executive Protection Agent, aka bodyguard, who likes her pantsuits, her world-traveling assignments and, most of all, being in firm control of every situation. She’s incredibly skilled at protecting her clients, referred to as principals, but she’s even BETTER at protecting her own heart from that nasty little bugger called “love”. There’s just one problem: Jack Stapleton: actor, heartthrob, and Hannah’s next principal, whether she likes it or not. After being dumped by her fellow agent, Robby, she’s not looking for love. Nope. She wants to get out of town as quickly as possible - preferably to London, if she can prove to Glenn that she deserves the spot by doing a good job on this assignment.Simple, right? As you know, things seldom go as planned, and Jack isn’t quite the simple assignment Hannah was expecting - especially when they have to fake a relationship for Jack’s family as a cover for Hannah’s presence in their home. But are these growing feelings fake too? Reality gets pretty fuzzy when you’re dealing with an actor.This is my first Katherine Center book, and it was ADORABLE! I see why so many love her writing. It was refreshing to see a strong female lead who was smart, capable, and despite past trauma, not defined by it. Hannah’s insecurities and self-doubt were relatable, as were Jack’s, since he was working through his own past trauma. Their interactions were funny, sweet, and tender. Even when bickering, they were a delight! The story arc involving his family and the interactions between Hannah and her co-workers all added a nice dimension to the story as well.I both read and listened to the audiobook, narrated by Patti Murin, and the audio took it to the next level. Murin’s gender voicing was very believable, and a couple voices - especially for Jack’s tabloid ‘girlfriend’ Kennedy Monroe, were hilarious! I highly recommend the audio.I loved this story! So why not the full 5 stars? A couple scenes of dialogue dragged on a bit too long, I couldn’t quite buy into the rationale of the ending event, and the oft dreaded epilogue went just a wee bit moralizing for my taste. Despite these things, I truly enjoyed my time with this story, and I’ll be watching for more from this author!★★★★ ½ (rounded to 4)Thanks to St. Martin’s Press, Netgalley and author Katherine Center for the digital ARC and Macmillan Audio for the audiobook, for which I’ve given my honest opinions. They’ll both be published on July 19, 2022."
415,13,The Bodyguard,Katherine Center,415,2022-09-04,Cara,5,"OH MY GOSH!!!! I LOVED THIS BOOK SO MUCH!!! The Bodyguard written by Katherine Center is such a fun, romantic rom-com. This book is so lovable with it's warmth, heart felt, and all around hilarious story line, but it also has it's serious moments. This book had so much action going on I felt like I was there actually witnessing it. The characters grab your heart, the setting grabs your heart, but also the story line grabs your heart. I loved the story so much I never wanted it to end!!! I was so excited when I found out this book was coming out, I've read other books by Katherine Center before, so I knew I had to read this one!!! This is the type of book that deserves so much hype, and an infinity star rating!!! I was hooked from the very first page and knew from that moment on that I was going to love this story. I went into this book completely blind, which I highly recommend doing because it will give you all the laughs and heartfelt moments without being spoiled. THIS BOOK ABSOLUTELY DELIVERED!!!!!!THANK YOU NETGALLEY and ST. MARTIN'S PRESS FOR THIS ARC!!!!!""So, all those times I called you and cried over my broken heart... you were dating the person who broke it?""Hannah Brooks is an Executive Protection Agent, aka The Bodyguard. Hannah looks more like a kindergarten teacher than someone who could kill you with a wine bottle opener, a ballpoint pen, a dinner napkin, but don't let her fool you, she's one tough woman. The Bodyguard started off a little bit sad with the death of Hannah's mother, following her funeral. But a few days after that, Hannah's boyfriend Robby broke up with her. Even though Hannah is not your average bodyguard standing at five feet tall, she refuses to let that be in the way of being the most knowledgeable in the business. Hannah's boss, Glenn, won't let Hannah back at work until she takes some time off and clear her head. I love how authors incorporate woman to be the tough one sometimes, woman who can kick some butt. Hannah was awkward in all the best ways possible, she had her flaws, but she was one of the coolest. Hannah most definitely didn't have the best self confidence, but she was such a good person. As soon as Robby broke up with Hannah, he made a list of Hannah's three deal breaker flaws. 1. Hannah's working all the time.2. Hannah's not fun, she's always serious every minute.3. Hannah's a bad kisser. While Hannah had to stay back in Texas to grieve the loss of her mother and clear her head space, Robby and Taylor, Hannah's best friend went to Madrid to complete an assignment. Taylor is now Hannah's ex-best friend because in Madrid her and Robby started dating. Now, Hannah just got hired to protect superstar actor, Jack Stapleton, from his middle-aged, corgi breeding stalker. Jack is a household name. He's famous for plenty of roles. But a few years back, after a family tragedy, Jack dropped back from the public eye and went off the grid. When Jack's mom gets diagnosed with cancer, he comes back home to the family's ranch in Texas to help out. Hank, Jack's brother wants nothing to do with him because of the cause of their family's tragedy. Jack doesn't want his family to know about his stalker, or the whole bodyguard thing. So, Hannah against her will finds herself pretending to be Jack's girlfriend as a cover, so his family doesn't know she's a bodyguard. Even though Hannah's ex boyfriend, Robby doesn't believe that Hannah's going to be Jack's girlfriend, Hannah can hardly believe it herself. The more time that Hannah spends with Jack, the more real it all starts to seem. As Hannah is Jack's girlfriend for cover, she actually feels herself falling for Jack. The time that Jack and Hannah spend together at the ranch they make each other laugh, but Jack annoys Hannah when he leaves his dirty clothes on the bathroom floor. It's so easy for Hannah to be the one protecting Jack, but protecting her own, long neglected heart? That's the hardest thing Hannah's ever had to do in her life. I absolutely loved the banter between Jack and Hannah, they were honestly so sweet and adorable together. Robby just annoyed me like crazy. If I was Hannah, I would have just drop kicked Taylor. What kind of best friend goes behind your back and sleeps with the person who broke your heart? I would certainly be pissed off."
416,13,The Bodyguard,Katherine Center,416,2022-03-23,Angelina,2,"This book has received so much praise that I went in with very high expectations (I should really stop doing that), only to be disappointed. The premise of “The Bodyguard” is totally up my alley: it’s a famous/non-famous fake-dating romance about a woman who becomes a bodyguard to an A-list actor. But many of the elements that I assumed would make this book a stand out for me didn’t work, mainly because the author insists on gesturing toward tropes without committing to them. If there’s Only One Bed, it’s understandable for a reader to expect the characters to have to share that bed (spoiler: they do not! not once! she sleeps on the floor! the whole time!). The Fake Dating trope raises the “Are These Feelings Real or Just Pretend?” issue, but Center doesn’t commit to that either. Instead, the emphasis is on the protagonist’s self-esteem, and whether or not she’s attractive enough to be seen with an A-lister. It’s all very 2000s––the idea that the protagonist is so “ordinary-looking,” and yet somehow “not like the other girls” goes unchallenged, as does the author’s portrayal of the “villain,” a shallow and painfully generic mean girl. Have we not evolved beyond this type of characterization? “The Bodyguard” sets its protagonist up as being excellent at her job (“you’re the best we’ve got!” vibes), but Hannah comes off as an amateur. She seems unprepared for her mission; she does no research beforehand and objects to her assignment at every step of the way. The power dynamic between Hannah and her boss is uncomfortable. This is a toxic workplace, depicted without a truly critical eye. Hannah’s awful ex and co-worker, Robbie, takes up too much space in the plot, and whatever the reader is supposed to feel toward Taylor (Hannah’s “best friend” and co-worker) is unachieved, since her relationship with Hannah is poorly established. The final conflict is perhaps the weakest element of the book. At the climax of the story, the person who turns out to be the actor’s stalker says they want to unalive themselves because their life is terrible. And Hannah, a trained professional, is unironically like, “oof, relatable.” Despite how the book is marketed, there’s something almost YA-ish about “The Bodyguard.” The writing has a Meg Cabot-esque voicy quality, and the concerns seem influenced by early Cabot and Kinsella romcoms. Like many of those stories, this romance is a fade-to-black, but it lacks the fun, biting, and sexy undercurrent that feels inherent to all great romantic comedies. The banter and chemistry between the book’s MCs is effective at times, but ultimately, these moments aren’t enough to rescue the book from everything that weighs it down.*Thank you to NetGalley for access to this ARC in exchange for my honest review.*"

 Best Banter!Another winner from a favorite author, Katherine Center. Heartwarming and charming, with a few unexpected turns! The narrator was fantastic.Hannah is an Executive Protection Agent, a bodyguard. She is assigned to protect superstar, heart throb actor Jack Stapleton from a threatening stalker. She may be small, but don't let that fool you, she is tougher than she looks.Part of the setting, takes place outside of Houston, my suburb (fun!) was mentioned a few times. There is also a 500 acre farm, with lots of cows and an enchanting garden. What an idyllic, paid vacation, escape from stress and a getaway for Hannah! But wait, things get tangly as Hannah tries to figure out the best way to keep Jack safe, his motives and body language.There was much to laugh about, sweetness and a few scenes that had Hannah springing into action! This was easy to imagine as a feel good movie, though I'm not sure who would play Jack. HmmmLight, closed door romance, fake dating trope. Perfect easy, breezy read!Thanks to Netgalley for the Audio Arc! OUT July 19, 2022"
418,13,The Bodyguard,Katherine Center,418,2022-09-19,Kezia Duah,4,"When I learn to kill someone with a napkin, it will be over for everyone. I’m ashamed to say that when I first saw the title and the book, I assumed the bodyguard would be a man. When I realized it was going to be a girl named Hannah, I got even more excited to start. Hannah is someone who doesn’t like opening up and the people around her definitely haven't made that easier on her. I like that it felt like she was struggling to open up to us as well as readers. I learned to love her like most of the characters in the book, as she also learned what love means and how good it can feel to be vulnerable to people you trust. There were some fan-favorite tropes in this one, and I'm always hoping authors put their unique spins on the popular ones and Center did not necessarily disappoint. I still wasn’t enthralled by Hannah and Jack’s relationship. Maybe a second pov could have helped? I’m really not sure. There was something there but it wasn’t enough for me. This part was really cute though. "
419,13,The Bodyguard,Katherine Center,419,2022-08-25,Allison Faught,4,"I’m not even kidding. (And this has never ever happened before.) I thought I was probably an estimated 25% of the way through the book and I was actually 75% of the way through. 😅 To be able to chokehold me into a book to the point that I’ve lost all meaning of which hand holds the weight of the book is actually pretty impressive. 😂 That is how sucked in I truly got!!Most of the time rom-coms can be corny and eye-rolling but, interestingly enough, I found myself grinning like an idiot at those corny lines. I loved the main characters and rooted for them 110%. This was an all the way 5 ⭐️ for me until a certain part in the book and I felt my expectations were too high and was slightly disappointed. I could see the ending coming….but I didn’t entirely like how it was handled… It didn’t really affect my score too much though because most of the book was pure bliss. Two things I really liked that I want to point out:1.) There is a usual trope in rom-coms that this book didn’t abide by and I was so grateful for that. I’d rather not say even though it’s not technically a spoiler.2.) Sometimes, when my husband is at work, I like going to my parents’ house as my mom and dad like watching my girls so I can read and have some ‘me time’ and ‘rest’ because pregnancy (although beautiful) is tiring, nauseating and everything hurts. I REALLY don’t need to be reading about the saturation or firmness of certain things while my dad’s playing Go Fish with my kids on the floor of the living room in front of me. I don’t mind those scenes usually, but as of current it has been a pet peeve. I can honestly say that this book does not delve into graphic sex scenes or anything like that and while hanging at my 60 year old parents’ house I’m truly thankful for that. I’m happy I started reading rom-coms again and I look forward to reading more from the author!4.25⭐️"
420,14,The American Roommate Experiment,Elena  Armas,420,2022-09-09,Zoe (Marauders version) ,5,"Ngl I'm having very unfictional feelings about very fictional characters This book was so good, so so good, with delicious romance and my amazing cinnamon roll Lucas MartianAKA my new book boyfriend (Maybe just as good as Aaron Blackford but lets not talk about that) this review has minor spoilers about gestures made by Lucas, and a lot more you have been warnedBut just know this quick breakdown if you haven’t read it yet and wanna know if you should: both povs, sunshine H that is so, so romantic and has set the bar even higher, phrases that are in spanish that are really the most romantic shot ever. And heart wrenching romance. Give it a go. Ps skip to the bottom of the review for a quote in bold. Thank me later. Anyways back to the review, you know what, let's talk about it. Because Lucas is just too good not to talk about. As once said by Taylor Swift, “I like shiny things but I’d marry you with paper rings.” The amount of effort Lucas put into those ‘experimental’ dates. You know he’s a keeper when you tell him that you wish you met him at your best friend's wedding and he bakes the freaking cake that was at the wedding dances with you on a rooftop and sets the entire thing up for his ‘best friend’ it’s giving Marinette and Adrien vibes.I’m the biggest sucker for extroverted boys with floppy brown hair, huge egos and will flirt tirelessly with you because you are the one and only and that was Lucas to a T. He was a big ball of sunshine and the smile didn’t disappear from my face the entire time I was reading this book. And his presence in the flat/studio apartment whatever you wanna call it was like a warm spring day. His amazing cooking, that he cooked everyday for Rosie btw, the flirty comments thrown in Rosie’s direction, the constant smiling and the phrases in spanish (that were totally the most romantic toe curling shot ever).  Deslumbrabte. Como el mismo sol Translation: dazzling. Like the sun itselfDon’t even get me started on the other three dates that he prepared for her. The bar is now high people. I expect this and no less. First he took her to a record store so they could find there soundtrack/song I love that 😭😭. And then they danced to it with a record player he found. The thought that had gone onto this 🥹🥹Secondly, the pizza date where both him and her made pizza together. Me and Rosie were very distracted with Lucas kneading the dough. It was so cute tho ✋🥹😭 I can’t with Lucas being his usual extroverted self flirting all the time and Rosie trying not to burst at the seams because she’s trying not to turn as red as a tomato. I love themAnd third the masquerade ball. THAT AARON WAS INVITED TO, WE GOT TO SEE THEM AGAIN AARON AND LINA I LOVE THEM. HE AND LUCAS’S BRO CODE WAS EVERYTHING. Anyways, the masquerade ball was the best. Them dressing up as characters from ‘their’ show. They have a show. I love them so much. And the fact I’m 98% sure it’s The Vampire Diaries makes me love that even more. It was the start of everything and god it was delicious. And you know what made it even better, we got both POV we were in Lucas’s head as he become slowly more and more obsessed with Rose and OH it was satisfying. It’s just so good when the girl falls first but the guy falls harder. But then we got to hear all his thoughts about how he thought he didn’t think he deserved Rosie because he was ‘broken’. When I tell you my heart broke for him. I was heartbroken. How could he think that? He was perfect. Doing all this for Rosie, all while keeping a smile on your face? I love him. If you didn’t already know bahaha.I loved when Rosie was so obviously checking Lucas out and he would say something like “like what you see?” Like yes sir I do, I’ll inflate your ego for you. AND THEN WHEN THEY FINALLY FUCKED THEY KEPT GETTING INTERUPTED LIKE STOP ✋ I WANTED TO READ THAT. When he left for Spain ngl I ugly cried it hurt me so much to see that. And how they were both so sad about it 😭😭 they loved each other so much it hurt me. Their banter, their jokes, I loved it all <33 I know i said before that he may be as good as Aaron Blackford but who am I kidding, no one can top Aaron. He is the standard. And the standard is sky high. But I will say Lucas is still amazing and I love him <333Also, you’ve probably noticed that I haven’t talked much about Rosie and that’s because in that first chapter what she did gave me very much second hand embarrassment. It was really awkward. She wasn’t like an amazing character that I was rooting for the entire time but she was okay. I didn't really connect to her, thats probably why, i'm not an aspiring writer and we are not similar. Maybe if we were then I might have liked her more. (there were some bad parts to this book I will admit but im not letting anything disappoint me, ive been waiting for this book for months, if i reread ill go into more detail for you, but for now this book will be positive in my mind)So no one sees that spoiler that skips down to the bottom:.............I’ll leave you with this quote:I felt his hum fall in my skin. “Not god” he said before retracing my opening with his tongue. “Lucas”And a huge thanks to my best friend Ty. For helping me write this because I had no idea how to write a good enough review for this amazing book. She also gave me: I'm having very unfictional feelings about very fictional characters  Which is geniusAnd a bunch more I'm sure you will read in future reviews. One honourable mention right now for one I love I still love to read fairytales, it's just a bit dirtier now. She is a literary geniusLove you babes <3{previous review }*whispers* Please let me see Aaron again, please let me see Aaron again , please let me see Aaron again, please let me see Aaron again, please let me see Aaron again, please let me see Aaron again, please let me see Aaron again, please let me see Aaron again, please let me see Aaron again, please let me see Aaron again, please let me see Aaron again, please let me see Aaron again.Oh and I almost forgot!

421,14,The American Roommate Experiment,Elena  Armas,421,2022-04-09,Ali Hazelwood,5,"edited to add: i can't believe i forgot to report my fave quote:“Lina me va a cortar las pelotas.”okay so hi. i have much to say. let's start with: AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHand then let us continue with: ijshfgiahiadfhgiarehgoerijroigheagnaeirgnjaerbgajrbgrsjhtbrhkand now let us be profesh: OUR EXPECTATIONS WERE HIGH, BUT HOLY SHIT DR. ARMAS. I kinda don't know where to start. Okay so: this is Lucas' story of course, and we know him from 1) cute pics of him and Taco, his doggo (who, we find out in this book during one of the sex scenes, once had diarrhea) (i promise it doesn't detract ELENA MAKES IT WORK) 2) the fact that Lina is his cousin and 3) the fact that when Rosie saw him on IG, she thought he was cute.Now. It's been a while since TSLD and Rosie, my girl whom I love, has been quietly thirsting after Lucas' instagram even since (as one does) (one = me. no matter what people say, Hyun Bin's instagram and I are a FAMILY.) So, Rosie is an engineer like Lina, but recently quit her job to write romance novels full time. (As an aside, her first book is like, a reverse Outlander type of deal, and I want to read it.) (Also her pen name is Rosalyn Sage which I love, I want to republish all my books under that name). Anyway, Rosie is in the midst of some big life changes, and that's when the roof of her apartment falls on her (literally.) She ends up having to stay in Lina's apt while Lina is gone (I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU WHERE LINA IS BUT I WILL LET YOU WILDLY SPECULATE ,MUAHHAHAHHAHAHA) and oooops, Lucas is also staying there (MUAHAHAHAHHAHAHAH X2) and there is only one bed (MUAHAHHAHAHAHA X 10000).So, Lucas is a professional surfer who's taking a few weeks off and currently traveling around the US because he needs a change of scenery following Things (TM) that Happened (TM). Now, something I looooved about TARE is that both Lucas and Rosie are in a really fragile moment in their lives because of various reasons that have to do with career, family, writer's block, the expectations of the people around them, etc. And what they need is a friend. Someone loving and supportive. And when they're both feeling super low...THEY FIND EACH OTHER. AND IT'S GLORIOUS. I mean, they have one of the best meet ugly in history, but after Lucas crash lands into Rosie's life they almost immediately have a connection and HE. IS. SUCH. A. SWEETHEART. He’s so charming and just genuinely nice and flirty. HE COOKS DELICIOUS FOOD!!! Also he is sooo supportive of Rosie’s life choices. Just. Just. LUCAS. *SWOONS* (I mean there is a scene guys where she needs a hug but she won’t admit it so he pretends to need one bc he misses Taco and i'm like... this man. i love this man.)Anyway, they sort of strike up a deal where he's going to help her get back into writing romance by showing her that dates can be good and fun (which leads to some deliciously meta moments since this is a romance novel) and of course... they start falling for each other, but they are both acutely aware that:1) he lives in Spain and he's only in NY temporarily2) if they hook up, Lina will shank Lucas3) he is recovering from something tough and feels like he has nothing to offerSO THEY TRY TO RESIST AND THERE IS DELICIOUS SLOW BURN TENSION AND GUYS. GUYS. GUYSSSS.(Oh yes the book is dual POV which is 900/10, A++++).But also, bc I know the people want to know: do we see Aaron?Yes.Do we see Lina?Yes.Do we see Aaron and Lina together?YUP.Is it perfect?*nods and wipes tears*CRONUT YOU FOR THIS BOOK, ELENADisclosure: Elena and I share the same literary agency (SDLA); I received an ARC from the publisher (I think? Maybe from our agency? It's a mystery. We shall never know.)"
422,14,The American Roommate Experiment,Elena  Armas,422,2022-08-08,Ayman,5,"Girl idk even where to begin but i can say that i’ve never felt an ache this fucking strong in my heart like i did when reading this book. The slow burn quite literally stabbed me in the heart, slit my throat, and carved its name onto my chest. it was so excruciatingly painful but in all the right ways. these characters are lovable from the start. this spin on acquaintances to friends to lovers was done so passionately that it made my heart cry tears of joy. the longing, the aching, the undeniable chemistry Rosie and Lucas have for one another had me clutching my chest the entire way through.Introverted Rosie was very relatable. idk there was just something so refreshing reading about her and the way she lusted for Lucas even before officially meeting him. her undeniable crush. her confidence and radiant energy growing and developing throughout the novel was just perfection. the entire way through i was like “yeah she’s just like me fr.” God this book had me in a headlock 🫣Lucas omg wow. he is just so easily lovable and funny and cute and hot af may i add. he was the perfect extroverted contrast to Rosie. and omgg he’d do that thing where he’d speak Spanish and Rosie would be like “hey what does that mean?” and he’d lie and say something silly like “it means i’m hungry” when in reality he just spitted out the most poetic romantic shit ever. like the sluttiest thing a man could do is flirt with you with his mother tongue 🫠 this man had me so distraught 😩 and dare i say he’s better than aaron blackford? i love them the same, i cant choose ughhhi was acting very questionably while reading this book. i was up all night finishing it and screaming into my pillow at times. Lucas has just a way with words that had me thinking very unhinged things…and the way he’s just so down and deep for Rosie…honestly it pissed me tf off because i know men like him just simply don’t exist in real life.anyways, this book is worth the read and it is better than TSLD when comparing the two. from the writing, to the plot, characters, romance, and the conclusion. i was literally crying reading the ending because it felt like a “finally about fucking time” moment. thank you atria publishing for the ARC"

427,14,The American Roommate Experiment,Elena  Armas,427,2022-09-09,ellie,2,"Elena Armas’ publishing agent: “so, how many tropes and cliches do you think you can wri—“Elena Armas: YES. all i got from this was that there is not an original thought in Elena Armas’ brain. this felt too... tropey. as though Elena Armas tried to think of as many popular tropes as possible and threw them into a melting pot to create this book.and tropes aren’t bad whatsoever— tropes can be the foundation of a story, the basic/generic ideas that initially get us (as readers) intrigued by the book, and we can then decide from the tropes whether we think the story is for us or not. but when you rely too heavily on the tropes and construct a story around them, i think it’s glaringly obvious and results in a story that lacks depth and uniqueness. and that’s what happened here for me. i know there’s recently been wider conversations within the book community and the publishing industry regarding what’s been dubbed “tropification”. im not gonna get into all of that, but i think this book was undoubtedly influenced by the latest trend of how tropes are dominating the romance genre. on top of this. the inner monologues of both characters were incredibly repetitive. Rosie and Lucas both thought the same things over and over again, to the point i was skimming chunks of pages because i had read the exact passage a few pages prior. while some of the “cute” lines Lucas fed Rosie were so unoriginal, i just didn’t feel anything at all. it just heightened the fact (to me, anyway) that the book was catering to the Instagram reel/TikTok trend of posting an out of context scene or piece of dialogue from a book that will have you on your knees, so you decide to go pick the book up... and find out the book isn’t even that good and the scene in question was actually pretty underwhelming.it was just far too jumbled and mismatched, not knowing what it wanted to be because the cliches and tropes were continuously stacking up, almost competing with one another. and this made for a pretty inconsistent read. like Rosie’s “unrequited crush”, for example, but it was pretty clear that Lucas liked her back almost immediately. (and because of this, you can’t tell me this was a slowburn romance— it was just insta-love masquerading as a slowburn). and i was totally down for the roommates/forced proximity aspect, but then the fake-dating was also thrown into the mix... and it just meant the book had too much going on, and while trying to juggle it all, lost any semblance of structure and direction. i think the story should have just been roommates to lovers OR fake-dating, not both. i just... it all felt so basic. there’s just no subtly. Lucas drops a compliment or sexual innuendo about Rosie every few sentences. and Rosie, every damn time, is like “OH super weird! it sounds like he’s flirting!? like he likes me?! impossible”. and originally, it was understandable with the type of person Rosie is, and i sympathised because ive always been really bad at knowing when someone flirts with me. but ffs, by the tenth compliment that was dropped in the span of a chapter, i couldn’t bare it any longer. her oblivious and klutzy nature was cute and fun at first, too, but got exhausting real quick. especially when it’s heightened by the fact that Rosie has never had any dating luck and it’s ALWAYS been super embarrassing. nearly every one of them have used and discarded of her. this is just a personal pet peeve though when it comes to romcom style romances— heroines who are constantly shit out of luck and never know a moment of peace make me wanna gauge my eyeballs out with a spork. let the ladies breathe, please. and their first smutty scene 💀💀💀 yall should have seen my face i was APPALLED.like why did you guys have to do it THERE?!?!!?? i skipped the whole thing. i know they eventually stopped but... y’all shouldn’t have even started, pack it up!! the scene that followed was good, though... i just couldn’t get over the first it was weird as fuck. i can’t even put it in a nice way it just ruined the vibes lmao. but it wasnt all bad. there were a handful of cute moments that actually felt authentic between Rosie and Lucas rather than a stilted, manufactured trope— him hugging her after she sees her brother was sweet, i liked it a lot, as well as the scene towards the end with Lucas’ dog, Taco. the Masquerade Ball and their final “date” were probably my favourites!! both fun, steamy and full of tension. the ball scene was the first time i really felt their chemistry and was convinced they had a real connection beyond the tropes forcing the connection. (although the phrase ”fuck you silly” actually made me curl my nose up, that almost ruined the whole vibe i can’t lie). then their final date was just so full of honesty and they were finally laying all of their cards on the table. while i also enjoyed him saying sweet things to Rosie in Spanish that she didn’t understand and he told her it was something super ordinary when in fact it was cute af. the little gestures that Armas incorporated worked so well. it was the big, grand ones that were suffocating because they were just so obvious and unauthentic. and there were too many of them. your readers aren’t dumb, you don’t need to shove so much down their throats. they can pick up on the small, minute cues you’ve laid out. and that elevates an authentic romance. i think if she’d stuck to that rather than the big tropes, this would have excelled. and Lina was annoying af as a side character (i legit skipped every interaction Rosie had with her because she was unbearable), so i have finally made the executive decision to not read TSLD. sorry, Aaron babe, but you’re not worth it if i have to slog through Lina’s POV for a whole damn book. goodbye. just overall, it’s pretty unoriginal. it’s not a bad book, it’s just... nothing new or special. cliches and tropes aren’t the bad guys here, they can be utilised exceptionally when they’re not solely relied upon to shape the novel and the characters are fully fleshed out. but neither Rosie nor Lucas were. they were very generic to me. Lucas was a cookie-cutter boyfriend, an amalgamation of all the “swoony” characteristics most readers like in a hero, and because of this was just rather bland. he could be anybody.honestly, i think if the trauma of his past had been fleshed out properly beyond him briefly telling Rosie about it in a moment of vulnerability at the end, it would have elevated him so much more. Rosie was fine. i didn’t mind her. like Lucas, i wouldn’t be able to identify her out of a line up, that’s for sure. just pure indifference. i just expected more from this since, when i was lucky enough to read the first chapter a bit early, i really liked what i read. the rest didn’t live up to it at all. by the last 15% i was skimming like crazy. i truly didn’t care anymore and it feels like ive wasted a whole day reading a book i didn’t really like :/ ****original review of the first chapter [26/08/22]****
And just when I thought I’d collected myself enough to say something else— hopefully marginally smart— his lips stretched. That puzzled look dissolved completely, giving way to a smile and whatever words had climbed to my mouth crumbed. Because he was smiling. And it was big and bright and quite frankly, beautiful in this blatant way you don’t really know what to do with.
just a disclaimer: when i requested this, i assumed the sampler was a lil bit longer than a single chapter, so trying to gauge how to rate this isn’t easy. originally i decided on three but ive changed it to four because i did really like this, but my rating is definitely subject to change when i read the whole book. but, i can give my brief, vague thoughts instead.(also, side-note: i have never read The Spanish Love Deception so my brief thoughts here are in no way influenced by the previous book).  ⟡ it was immediately engaging— it was unique and fun, and i found myself laughing a few times.⟡ Rosie was funny, charming and endearing. she was witty and maybe a bit quirky, but in a cute way. i instantly liked her!⟡ Lucas seemed lovely with a humorous and playful energy about him. ⟡ the book jumps right into story straight away— i love when authors do this, rather then a slow build up. i just want to be in on the important stuff straight away, otherwise im bored to tears waiting for something to actually happen. ⟡ Rosie and Lucas’ first interaction, again, was pretty funny. it wasn’t trying too hard to be quirky, but instead felt authentic in a way that showcased both MCs personalities. it’s safe to say i definitely want to read this when the rest is released, despite having zero interest in TSLD. i may even pick it up if i end up enjoying this one!thank you to NetGalley, and Simon and Schuster UK for the sneak peek!"

Lovers from a afar, shared proximity, and a chemistry between two soulmate seeking lovers that will fill you with angst and tender, emotional romance of the best kind...
**SIGHS** This book... this story... this romance! What can I say other than the fact this was a true refreshing love story to read. One that I have not read in such a long time. That's mostly due to the fact that I have been on a cliche band of just reading smutty romances, insta-love romance, etc. But with that being said, my love for this story is pure. To me, this was such a comfort romance that made me take my time to thoroughly appreciate and enjoy. And both Rosie with Lucas together, know how to make that ideal romance couple that as a reader makes you just instantly swoon over them. It's the beauty of Lucas, the way his personality is. That's what attracts you to keep on reading and wanting more of him. More of his sunshine personality, but still shows signs of vulnerability that makes him this beautiful kind man. More of his tender careful attention that he has towards Rosie, listening to her, caring for her, loving her. Even when he doesn't even know that he is doing it. He is just... 
Lucas Martin.
And then we have Rosie... my gosh dear Rosie. An independent woman, who seeks not only for validation in herself, but is also nervous of her family finding out the truth towards the path she has taken. Rosie is a strong character that demonstrates the inner battles of herself. But at the same time, just knows what she wants. That's why when she first ""meets"" Lucas, you just know that these two are meant to be. They are both two individuals seeking for that love and passion that nobody has been able to give them in the way they are looking for. Rosie instantly knows and does not question it;

 “And I imagined this, his hug, his body, him, being my safe-heaven. My normal. My bad days, my good days. My every day...""

As their experiment starts to evolve, Lucas starts to notice that his heart is eating him alive. Eating him from the inside out, his heart is taking control of him. But he struggles to let himself be the person that Rosie wants him to be. With the all beautiful flaws, Rosie wants him and only him. And Lucas, after time just knows that he wants her and only her. His happiness comes second, while hers comes first. Her battles and obstacles come first and he is not afraid to fight them for her. To conquer them with her. That's why this story is refreshing. It takes you to another world of tender yet careless love that makes you giggle, cry, and just utterly swoon.This dual pov romance has everything and anything you may need in an emotional story. Do not be deceived by my review though, because once Lucas gets his hands on Rosie... his body controls him in the best of ways. And if you know what I am talking about... you just know. **wink wink** Elena has a keen talent for making me crave more of her writing. And I am looking forward to seeing what else she has in store for all of us romance readers. PS. For those Aaron lovers, you do NOT want to miss out on this story. Because Lina and Aaron do show up, and they are just... AHHHHHH SO GOOD!ARC BETA kindly provided by my bestie Elena, in exchange for an honest review...Follow Me On:Instagram ❀ Twitter ❀ Goodreads ❀ Facebook"
429,14,The American Roommate Experiment,Elena  Armas,429,2023-01-01,Cindy,2,"Didn’t feel any chemistry between the characters and some of the things that happened were unintentionally funny, i.e. the love interest saying he finds yellow paint attractive after he sees a picture of the main character dressed as a Minion, the love interest calling her an “avenging angel” after he stops her from throwing her purse at an attacker, etc. The best parts about these types of books are the smut scenes but this couple was constantly getting interrupted and giving me blue balls too. How dare you!"
430,14,The American Roommate Experiment,Elena  Armas,430,2022-11-03,jessica,3,"this is the ultimate fluff. the perfect kind of perky, happy-go-lucky romance you want that comes with a happily ever after tied with a nice, pretty bow.but its the kind of lighthearted tropetasticness that begins to feel like over-the-top cheesiness if you arent in the mood for it. and, unfortunately, i dont think i was.which is just too bad because i really do think this is a cute book. but i just didnt feel whole-heartedly invested in the story until near the end when the tone starts to settle down a bit and the characters become a more grounded. so again, i just dont think i was in the mood for something so unserious. not a bad book by any means, it just didnt personally capture my full interest at this particular moment. ↠ 3 stars"
431,14,The American Roommate Experiment,Elena  Armas,431,2022-10-06,SK,2,"It could not create the same magic as The Spanish Love Deception.Let's go over the tropes in this one-✔️Dual POV ✔️Fake dating ✔️Roommates to friends to lovers✔️Forced proximity ✔️Masquerade Ball ✔️Slow burn ✔️Yearning for each other✔️Girl falls first ✔️Spice (1.5/5) So despite such amazing tropes, what went wrong? Buckle up, cause this review borderlines a rant review. *sigh* So we have the  FMC- Rosie  Lina's best friend who quit her job and wants to be an accomplished writer. She already has one major published book, but due to a writer's block- she is unable to write the second one. I don't wanna be the one to call out the author on that. But it all felt a bit too personal. Like Elena Armas was talking about her own struggles. It did drag on and felt like a narrative of her personal complaints. Sorry not sorry, but this is constructive criticism. Then we have the  MMC- Lucas  who is Lina's cousin, and that's all there is to his personality? He does have his own sweet moments but it's not enough. Sadly, the author could not write Lucas the way she wrote Aaron Blackford - with love. The book does start really well. But the problem started when I was 200 pages in, and the characters had barely made a move on each other. It's still supposed to be a romance book right?! I get it, it's a slow burn, the characters are yearning for each other. But how is it that I'm halfway through the book and all I know is they like Pizza?! How do you manage to babble for so long?! It's at this point I start losing interest in romance and the book as a whole. Sadly, even Aaron and Lina's presence could not save it. Look, Elena is a very talented writer. She knows how to make you laugh, cry and swoon. But if the author does not have a heart to write, why force yourself? Take a break, re-read your draft and then publish. The second half of the book went on and on to no avail. We have one interesting character - Olly, Rosie's brother. I think he holds a lot of potential and maybe it's his story we get to read next? I personally was more invested in him than Rosie and Lucas. Look, don't get me wrong, Lucas and Rosie are quite likable but while I wanted something that makes me feel things all I got was a boring story. The spice is good, I'll give it that. But I had stopped caring about the story by the time it happened 🤷‍♀️ I ended up skimming through fair bit once I hit the 300 page mark. It does have its sweet moments, I did like the ending. It was quite satisfying and absolutely adorable, which is why I rate it three stars instead of two.If you want to read this, go ahead. Maybe you'll like it more than me. But I personally had high hopes. So yeah, am disappointed."

That freaking, sizzling, sex oozing chemistry between Lucas and Rosie put the entire chapters into fire! I loved this second book of the series so much more! It’s genuine, it’s entertaining, it’s soooo ROMANTIC! Especially the experimental dating ideas Lucas comes up with are brilliant! Lucas was selfless, caring, sweet, playful, sex god who is also hell of chief! And Rosie is sweet, kind hearted, fixer, also selfless, perfect heroine!The characterization is perfect! The highest rate of chemistry pouring out from the chapters captivates you. The plot is also intriguing with forced proximity room-ance and friends to lovers tropes!  Can you imagine to stuck in a tiny studio with hottest Spanish god: a surfer/ a cook/ the guy you’ve been drooling over and stalking on social media for a year as you suffer from writer’s block! Poor Rosie Graham moves to her best friend Lina’s apartment after ceiling off her own apartment nearly collapses on her! And she has no idea that Lina’s hot cousin Lucas she’s daydreaming decides to use his spare key to crash at the same place at the last minute. Both of them finally come to an understanding they should share the apartment, becoming close friends. Lucas also offers Rosie to go out four experimental dates to help breaking her writer’s block! But now Rosie has second thoughts about this experimental dating decision. Because five weeks later, Lucas will pack his bags and leave the continent for good! But what if their dating is something more than experimental, what if everything is real? Lucas still deals with the injury of his leg and his emotional distress. He thinks he’s not good enough to make a woman happy but what if he embraces his fears, taking a chance for his own HEA!No more words! I wish I can give this book 10 stars! This is one of the best romance books I’ve devoured this year! I HIGHLY ABSOLUTELY EXTREMELY RECOMMEND IT!"

438,14,The American Roommate Experiment,Elena  Armas,438,2022-09-10,Aviva’s Library,2,"Unfortunately, I did not love this book. It felt very similar to alot of other books I’ve read in the past - the two most prominent ones being Josh and Hazels Guide to Not Dating mixed with a bit of Beach Read… and I just didn’t feel like this was anything special or unique.I didn’t latch onto either of the characters, I found a lot of moments to be pretty cheesy, and I almost felt like the story was written with the booktok/booksta community in mind… knowing all the tropes and elements that’ll make an average romance reader swoon - and I do not mean that as an insult to any reader who loved this story - if you gave me this book two years ago, I probably would have given it 5 stars… but I’m much pickier now and this one just didn’t stand out to me as something different or original. I guess I was expecting more, idk. I also don’t think that instant attraction mixes very well with slow burn. If they are both drooling over each other from day one and there’s no forbidden aspect keeping them apart - then the slow burn just doesn’t make sense and becomes an unneeded tease. There was also a lot of side plots going on that weren’t needed or important to the story and every single time a scene wasn’t about Rosie and Lucas, I got bored.I also feel like there were a couple of missed opportunities. A big one being with Lucas and his ingury/career issue. I feel like it was there to give us a ‘damaged character’ but it didn’t end up diving deep into it. There was also a wasted opportunity with the one bed situation - plus there was no real groveling at the end (one conversation does not count - especially when you specifically point out the importance of groveling in romance books)"
439,14,The American Roommate Experiment,Elena  Armas,439,2022-09-08,Matilda ,2,"2 stars 🍑if elena armas’ goal was to put me to sleep then she’s certainly succeeded! my grade in OB will be thanking her immensely because i studied all afternoon yesterday to avoid touching this sleepfest reading this review may ruin the reading experience, so…spoilers!i think we need to set the record straight about friends to lovers…childhood friends >>>>>> new friendsnew friends is incredibly hard to pull off because it’s hard to develop that connection between 2 strangers without having some sort of indifference between them. like...they were practically lusting after each other from the get go. this book did new friends particularly bad. lara wonderfully laid it out on her review, but lucas (H) and rosie (h) had way too much trust, way too soon.for example, how was rosie spilling her biggest secret to lucas on their second meeting ever…a secret only 2 people in the entire world knew (i.e. lina and aaron)plus, it felt like there was zero development???the fake dating did nothing to progress their relationship, to me anyway. idk why but lucas’ flirty behavior during their experimental dates felt actually fake to me. isn’t the point of a fake dating trope supposed to be when we realize it’s not fake, but the heroine doesn’t??“I feel that. Poor little guy.”“You get sweaty hands, too?”Lucas made sure he was meeting my gaze when he said, “I would if I was trying to work up the courage to kiss a girl like you.”
the conflict at the end + the separation was stupid. it was just lucas being an idiot boy. there was no reason for any of it.the author really threw every trope imaginable at our faces and expected us to love it🧍🏻‍♀️ waiting for the day that romance authors move away from putting together random tropes that last 2 pages just so they can say they had them...*cough* one bed, gray sweatpants, fake dating *cough*let me list every single trope in this book:↠ fake dating↠ formed proximity↠ friends to lovers↠ girl obsessed + crush↠ cinnamon roll hero↠ slowburn + “spice”↠ roommates↠ quirky heroine↠ scarred hero↠ best-friend’s cousindon’t even get me started on the amount of secondhand embarrassment i got from lucas & rosie’s first meeting 😖also, LINA WAS SO FUCKING ANNOYING!!!!!! her whole scolding towards lucas and rosie’s “relationship” was so dumb. i love how her excuse for not supporting any sort of relationship between was that lucas has never brought a girl home to meet his family 🤓🤓 i have to admit that there were a couple cute moments, which is why this book is getting an extra star. the shower scene???? that was actually hot af 🫶🏼 i love when the h walks in on the H while he’s jacking off.what wasn’t cute was them getting steamy in a public. bathroom. absolutely NOT🤢🤢also, i liked the parallel between their first meeting and them reuniting at the end 🥰
“I couldn’t wait a second more to start our new life together, Rosie. I’ve waited enough. I’ve waited a lifetime without me knowing. So why don’t you open this door and let me show you?”
the only thing that could have saved this book is if lucas and rosie got struck by lightning when they were standing on a roof during a storm, having their first kiss. now THAT would have been interesting 😮‍💨"
440,14,The American Roommate Experiment,Elena  Armas,440,2022-09-07,Penny,2,"it honestly pains me to write this. i had high hopes for this book and i really wanted to like it, but the more i read, the less i enjoyed it. i'm too exhausted to write a proper review but i still want to rant a bit 😂🗽 if you're gonna make a slowburn THIS SLOW i expect the characters to go from point A to point Z and through all the steps in between. i expect each interaction to add something to their relationship. i'm not the biggest fan of friends to lovers but if you're going down that route, then i expect them to slowly go from two random people, to friends, to good friends, to something more. but imo, there's barely a difference in the way they interact in their second scene together, their tenth one and their 334897th one. they instantly trust and like and are attracted to each other. which is good for them i guess, but not for me.. cause then why are they hooking up so late in the story? the ""slowburn"" serves no purpose at all when they're just repressing their feelings from the very beginning. say what you want about Catalina's irrational dislike of Aaron in TSLD, but at least she changed her feelings throughout the story. i felt 0 development here.🗽 the heroines' sense of humor in this series is definitely not for me 😭 and this is coming from someone who gave TSLD a 5 star rating, but there's only so much quirkiness i can take. i liked Rosie but the secondhand embarrassment was REAL. there was no better reminder that Lucas was fictional than whenever he would laugh at her embarrassing remarks, cause any sane person irl would've run out of there so quickly skfkdsk i feel mean but i said what i said.🗽 the fact that i saw so many quotes from this book in the past few months honestly did TARE a disservice. most of the ""swoon-worthy"" moments were spoiled for me and whenever i got to those quotes from Lucas, i was just like ""ah.. already saw this on ig 🤷‍♀️"".🗽 what was the purpose of the dating experiment? i felt NOTHING during those dates. absolutely nothing. i felt more during their little domestic moments. i've seen some reviews already saying this and i agree, there were just too many tropes floating around. i think they could've just been roommates and it would've been enough, no need to add so many things.🗽 ""croughnut you"", Lucas saying Rosie reminds him of a flower (no shit!)... the cringe, oh my god. but the worst part?? him whispering ""dulce de leche"" in her ear while she looked at him like 😍🥵 LMAOOOO it's giving the omelette du fromage scene from dexter's lab. just pretend i'm inserting that gif here cause i'm too lazy to look it up 🧍‍♀️🗽 Aaron, te amo. that hasn't changed 😌 but why was Lina a little more annoying here...? 😭🗽 i want to end this on a positive note: there were still cute moments. both Lucas and Rosie were likable MCs. i liked how much they were there for each other. that moment when Lucas pretended he needed a hug just so he could give her one 🥺 it made me so softtt. but i don't know, it really fell short on every other aspect 💔"

CAN COOK? bye. perfect. aaron blackford is still my #1 tho, but i did love lucas. rosie was really sweet and relatable, and i loved seeing her gain confidence throughout the book. the ending was very cheesy and yet it really got me, ngl. overall i liked it a lot. there were definitely some parts missing, if that makes sense? it didn’t hit as hard as tsld for me. but i still had a good time. it was more fluffy and fun!! rosie & lucas saying each other’s name in every sentence tho… that was annoying. the lina & aaron appearances. thank u for that elena armas. 🦋🦋🦋"

443,14,The American Roommate Experiment,Elena  Armas,443,2023-01-28,Isa Cantos (Crónicas de una Merodeadora),5,"“I read you like you were my favorite book, Rosie. Like I’ve memorized you”.The American Roommate Experiment es el libro de romance slow burn más slow burn que he leído en la vida, pero lo amé muchísimo.Aquí todo empieza porque Rosie, la mejora amiga de Lina, de The Spanish Love Deception, tiene varios problemas en su vida. Uno de ellos es que renunció a su trabajo en la compañía de ingeniería para dedicarse completamente a ser autora de libros de romance, pero las cosas no están saliendo muy bien porque tiene una fecha de entrega muy pronto y está en un bloqueo de escritura tremendo, pues siente que no tiene inspiración. Por otra parte, su apartamento acaba de sufrir un gran daño… y es que se le cayó parte del techo encima, así que literalmente no tiene en dónde vivir en ese momento, por lo que decide aprovechar que el apartamento de Lina, que en ese momento está en su luna de miel con Aaron, está vacío. Entonces Rosie recoge sus cosas y va hacia allí, pero lo que no sabe es que el primo de Lina, que se llama a Lucas, también se está quedando allí. Y la cosa no acaba en ese momento, pues Rosie tenía muchísimas ganas de conocer a Lucas en la boda de su amiga en España, pero él nunca fue, así que su crush se quedó solamente como un crush de stalkearlo en Instagram. Entonces encontrarse con él en persona es algo que nunca se esperó, pero, por cosas extrañas del destino, terminan compartiendo ese apartamento y haciendo un experimento. Para que Rosie tenga más inspiración para su novela, Lucas va a salir con ella en una citas falsas para darle esos momentos románticos que le hacen falta a su novela… y a su vida. Ya se imaginarán cómo se desarrollan las cosas cuando hay proximidad forzada, cuando hay un súper crush de por medio, cuando la tensión crece y crece y cuando empiezan a salir en estas citas falsas y Rosie se da cuenta cada vez más de lo perfecto que es Lucas. Es dulce, atento, cariñoso y muy buena persona, ¡yo en serio lo amé! Y, obvio, al mismo tiempo Lucas también se va dando cuenta de la mala idea que tuvo al ofrecerse para esas citas falsas, pues claramente está empezando a sentir cosas muy, muy fuertes por Rosie… y digamos que no son fáciles de controlar.Para mí, definitivamente lo mejor del libro fue Lucas. Me pareció absolutamente espectacular. Además, es un hombre que está escondiendo un gran secreto y que no está de viaje, paseando por el mundo y por Nueva York, porque sí. Antes solía ser un surfista competitivo, pero algo pasó en su vida y está intentando encontrarse de nuevo, hacer las paces con lo que le sucedió y crear un nuevo camino para él mismo porque en realidad se siente muy perdido. Y a pesar de que está empezando a sentir estas cosas increíbles por Rosie, siente que no puede atarla a él por todo el equipaje que trae consigo, porque no se siente suficiente para ella. Es uno de los protagonistas más hermosos y boyfriendleables que he leído en la vida. Ojalá un Lucas en la vida real. Un Lucas con su perro. ¡El perro es muy importante!Rosie, por otra parte, es una gran protagonista porque siempre tiene en la cabeza todos estos ideales de las novelas de romance que se chocan con el bloqueo que está teniendo. Me encantó también cómo habla todo el tiempo de su crush con Lucas y de lo imposible que sería tener algo con él. Y una de las cosas que más amo es que es una protagonista que tiene la lengua muy larga, no se corta con lo que dice, tiene pensamientos muy pervertidos y muy sucios y eso me mataba de la risa. Obviamente disfruté muchísimo de la interacción de ella y de Lucas porque en un punto ya estuvo muy claro que los dos estaban muy, muy, muy colados por el otro, pero no estaban haciendo nada por miedo, porque Lucas tenía una fecha límite de estar en Nueva York y se devolvería España, porque Rosie tenía miedo de lo que Lina pensara si se metía con su primo y demás. ¡Ah! Y es que obvio hay unos cuantos cameos de Lina y Aaron cuando vuelven de su luna de miel. Y fue súper divertido volverlos a ver, sobre todo a Aaron porque aunque siempre es súper callado y misterioso, sabía todo lo que estaba pasando.Y, bueno, cuando por fin llegan los momentos épicos de romance que hemos esperado a lo largo de todo el libro, cuando por fin se resuelve toda la tensión… uf. Les juro que Elena Armas no decepciona. Todo es tremendo y Lucas… maaaadre mía. Voy a dejar que se imaginen el resto. Pero sepan que todo es increíble y, de hecho, el ritmo de este libro me pareció muchísimo mejor que el de The Spanish Love Deception, así que eso es una gran mejora. "

And I’ll love you for the rest of my life if you let me.”This was a rom-com about chasing your dreams, self-confidence, love and family. The American Roommate Experiment follows Rosie as she tries to break her writers block and moves in to her friend's place because the ceiling in her apartment breaks. But Rosie doesn't realize that Lina offered her apartment to her cousin, Lucas. Then Lucas comes up with a great idea to fix her writer's block, he will take her on experimental dates to give her inspiration, but only if she doesn't fall in love with him.This book was good, but the characters felt flat and the pacing was inconsistent. The pacing was good in the beginning, but it slowed down in the middle. The plot was interesting, but in the middle it was boring at times. I liked Rosie, she is independent, kind, and helpful, but at times she was clueless. I liked Lucas, he is kind, sweet, selfless but he felt flat. I was hoping Lucas would have more complexity and depth. I loved Taco, he is so adorable! I liked the side characters especially Aaron, Lina and Rosie's dad. There were a few cute moments between Lucas and Rosie, but many were too cheesy. The chemistry between the characters was good, but I felt that a spark between them was missing. I really liked the ending and I'm glad it ended on a happy note."

450,15,Funny You Should Ask,Elissa Sussman,450,2022-04-24,Hannah B.,2,"✨Funny you should ask I hate it✨If you don’t like books with flashbacks that culminate to nothing. Don’t read it. If you don’t like books with random “articles” and “interviews” thrown in between the actual plot. Don’t read it. If you don’t like books about “great writers” who when you read their “great writing” you’re like um no? Don’t read it.Now that I know this book was heavily *inspired* off of a GQ article (about Chris Evans) that the author fails to mention in her acknowledgements, I hate it all even more. I dislike the article because I again found it weird and unethical and weird and I don’t like knowing this shit really happened. Please don’t feel up the people you’re interviewing. And in the book she kept referencing how he was probably too drunk but she still wanted to get that sound bite. I checked my arc against a finished copy and the author still didn’t mention Edith Zimmerman or that GQ article anywhere in the book/acknowledgments. The rest of my review is also checked against a finished library copy. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt but alas. ✨Their relationship presented in the article felt unethical and the writing style was a mix of flashbacks, present, and useless “articles” and “interviews” and “blog posts” thrown in to break up the plot for no reason. I really don’t like when those things pop up in books. I stuck with them at the beginning because I was still interested in the “plot,” but then I realized nothing they revealed was actually useful to the overall story and I skimmed the rest. I mean the plot didn’t reveal anything either, let alone the flashbacks. Why do flashbacks get incorporated when the big “fight” scene in the past is just. so. boring? I did like the beginning (until the faked dog death and then I was one button press away from full on meltdown) and I was interested to see what really happened in the past. But the more I went along, I felt like her article was unprofessional and awkward and made me feel weird. She kept talking about all of these stereotypes, when her article did its best to perpetuate them? And she was so sad and angry that she had friends with private jets because she didn’t know if her career was “earned” or not. Plot twist it was not because what else did she have to write about? I can’t imagine she had three collections of essays published. Essays on WHAT. She proves none of her skills to me, which is another tough sell in books: writers, songwriters, etc always just seem so forced and awkward in books and the secondhand embarrassment is cruel to me. She was so whiny about her writing especially when she thought he didn’t like it. ✨I suppose the dude was more decent, but I still didn’t like him. He sounded nice in theory but the execution was lacking. The whole marriage thing and friends with benefits thing was just not what I wanted to see from him and it made him Not Hot. He was kind of a dick but so was she so they belong together in their phallus palace I suppose. We also finished this book with them knowing each other for a collective six days in ten years. I didn’t buy that. This book was based on a much shorter, insubstantial in its own right article and it shows. Maybe the article really did happen like the journalist said, but that didn’t make this book any more logical. And it doesn’t have to be but it just had a weird feeling. I was more stressed out at her being invited to after parties and passing out and getting drunk. I felt zero chemistry between the characters by the end and I disliked both of our MCs which is impressive. She’s angry that people got the wrong impression from an article she intentionally wrote to give the wrong impression and I just……… ✨On that ……….. note, there’s a lot of stilted speech (especially during the sex scene) where they’re like “can…I…..please…….Alaska…….ninety…..seven…..” and she’s like I don’t know what he means but okay and I’m like no not okay I don’t know what’s going on???? After this book I ban ellipses. Funny…you…should…ask…I…am…in…pain…✨ ”It’s not a problem,” he says. “With you, I…” / “You…?”✨ “I just…these fucking…goddamn buttons,”✨ “There…Please…Gabe…Please…”✨ ""Don't,"" he chokes out, stilling my hand. ""I...you…can't...""✨ ""Fuck,"" he groans. ""Can I...can we…..please..?”✨ “Gabe…” / ""Don't...stop...Please..don't...""✨ ""Yes..."" My head goes back. ""I need...yes...""✨ ""Fuck, I'm...""^Those all happened in the five page sex scene. It took 90% for:I’m also very confused because the author recently wrote an article about the importance of sex scenes in romance and that leaves me even more confused…this sex scene was an afterthought at 90%…and…lukewarm…at best... It’s nice to know the author loves sex scenes, but where is this proof in this pudding? The pining was pretty good but the payoff was stale. Vague is en vogue here. The words “orgasm,” “climax,” “peak,” “come” were never used during the sex scene. “Got off” and “coming” were each used like twice at various points. No “cock” was ever mentioned. I think “length” (mentioned once at 91%) is as good as it got. There’s like nothing regarding her body. Wait! We got: “Hands. Hips. Lips.” Oo baby, oo baby. 👁🫦👁 Le sigh. The author does this so many times at all times and I never knew what she was talking about and she also referenced things that happened to these characters as if we knew what they were and then like three pages later she defined them and I’m like……………..I just wasted five minutes rereading past pages to see if I missed the information!The way I read the ellipses sections in my head was a mix between Bella Swan’s pauses and Anthony Bridgerton’s heavy breathing. Imagine how detailed the sex scene was! Imagine it! Are you imagining it? Bc I guarantee whatever you’re imagining is hotter than the book’s one pathetic attempt at sexual ellipses.✨Yes. I am one of those angry Goodreads reviewers she mentions in the pointless filler interludes. Funny you should ask.The only thing I liked by the end (besides the fact that I was done) was his reveal of what happened in the past. It didn’t warrant a breakup and ten years of pining but it was funny. But even then, it wasn’t even revealed in a flashback so my previous point of them being useless still stands. I can see why people like this book, but it checked all the wrong boxes for me.⭐️⭐️.25/5 🌶🌶/5P.S. From 30% to 60% this book tricks you into believing it killed a dog (that you saw as a puppy) and that’s fucking sick.I cried but not bc of anything revolutionary the book did. No I lost it at “wow what a cute puppy ten years ago but time is crazy and now the dog is dead and wow just kidding this dog is actually alive but your dog is still dead have a great life bitch.” I gave the book the benefit of the doubt and kept reading to see if the dog actually was dead and thank god it wasn’t but I was triggered and had a terrible time I can’t believe they expect people to be okay with that. That’s a big gamble. From 30% to 60% and now all that in between % has been tainted and now I’m just pissed off. Thanks to the publisher for my advanced copy! All opinions are honest and my own as always ✨***SPOILER***And to circle back to “great writers” in books not being great writers, I politely ask how the fuck she got the assignment of interviewing him in the first place???? SHE HADN’T EVEN SEEN A BOND MOVIE.Also who the fuck was reading a third collection of her essays? What did she have to write about??? I absolutely don’t understand.I am pain.Me talking to the plot:"
451,15,Funny You Should Ask,Elissa Sussman,451,2022-05-21,Ayman,4,"ok so if you’ve been waiting to scratch that emily henry itch then read this book. this book was written incredibly well. it has a “love and other words” format in which it goes from the “then to now” timeline. 1 interview and the 2nd interview 10 years later. i was mostly reading this for the character development not really the romance but i feel it’s worth picking up if you want a romance book that’s more women’s fiction if anything else. i will say this book was the slowest of slow burns but it’s all worth it. trust. there is a little miscommunication but it actually works for the plot and it makes sense. this book goes through the highs and lows of combating addiction, success/fame, and love. it kinda reminds me of a taylor jenkins reid book ngl. if emily henry’s books and tjr books had a baby this would be it. the ending was the most happiest thing to read it made my heart ache…in a good way.

456,15,Funny You Should Ask,Elissa Sussman,456,2023-03-10,Nilufer Ozmekik,4,"Well, there are so many mixed reviews about this book! I actually respect everyone’s opinions and big buzz about this book’s story is based on Chris Evan’s whirlwind, entertaining and unconventional interview he’s made with Edith Zimmerman on 2011 for GQ article!  I read the article and it’s possible that author might be inspired by the idea of a celebrity and reporter’s extra entertaining weekend with lots of unexpected events, drunk talks ended with reporter’s crushing in movie star’s house! At this book; Chani Horowitz makes an interview with movie star Gabe Parker she’s having a big crush for years( she even uses his photo showing his abs as a wallpaper of her phone) which puts her on the map of famous article writers and also gives enough credit to Gabe to become next Bond even he’s American and he’s called a hick! I have to be honest ten years to fix your unresolved feelings and finding each other with the person you’ve spent only six days it’s not logical for two divorced people who have been through a lot! But this is a romance story! We all love Notting Hill when famous movie star Julia Roberts stand in front of a boy asking him to love her! So what if these two people who still try to find their place and their own success in the universe fall for each other? Is it still impossible? No it’s not! It’s about emotions, attraction, your soul’s calling! Or maybe it’s fantasy! But it’s still good to believe in fairy tales!  I believed in Gabe and Chani’s chemistry! It was real! Their love story was too instant. Gave was still dealing with his insecurities. He didn’t think he deserved to be James Bond and when he spent those romantic days with Chani, he still questioned his own value. I found both of them impulsive, childish because of the things they’ve done in ten years. But all those wrongdoings, mistakes, lies, misunderstandings were necessary! Because if they didn’t do those mistakes and separated apart,they would ruin the possibility of happiness between them. They were too young, impulsive, dumb, impatient to know the real value of great love!Now they met again to make another interview. Chani is successful article writer, publishing her upcoming book, divorced after 6 years old marriage as Gabe waltzed around rehab centers, finally divorced, trying to fix his tarnished reputation.They can both get benefited from the new interview but are they mature enough to face the rekindling feeling between them?Overall: I loved the smart, sarcastic writing style! I especially enjoyed to read blog parts of Chani! The instant love and some immature behaviors of the characters made me pissed off but I still love this book so much and I’m truly looking forward to read more works of this gifted writer! And I definitely agree with her about Philadelphia is underrated work and still one of the best romcoms of movie history! Many thanks to NetGalley and Random House Publishing Group/ Ballantine for sharing this amazing digital reviewer copy with me in exchange my honest thoughts."
457,15,Funny You Should Ask,Elissa Sussman,457,2022-06-02,Anna,2,"Ooookay... Where to start.I heard so many great things about this book. I was ready to write the most glowing review ever made before I even picked it up, which is why it breaks my heart that I’m only giving it two stars.This story was inspired by a real GQ profile of Chris Evans from 2011, written right before the first Captain America came out (you can find it here https://www.gq.com/story/chris-evans-...). If you haven’t read it, let me tell you: it reads like a romance novel. The journalist basically goes on a date with Chris Evans where he’s all flirty and touchy and cute, then they go to a party at his house where she drinks too much and ends up passing out in his guest room and sneaking out at 5 am. Then they go to a premiere where she meets his whole family and they all make fun of her. I don’t want to say it’s the best thing ever written, but it's up there.Funny You Should Ask was inspired by that profile, meaning the heroine, Chani Horowitz, is tasked with writing a profile on Gabe Parker, this hot actor who’s about to take on the role of a lifetime – this time, James Bond. The article turns out to be just as much of a hit as Chris Evans’s (it's also basically the same article, lol), and the book is split between the interview that led up to it, the handful of times Chani and Gabe met again over the next ten years, and the present, where she’s in her late thirties and he’s in his early forties, and she’s supposed to write a follow-up article on him.Over the ten years between the two interviews, Chani and Gabe’s lives changed completely. Gabe struggled with alcoholism, they both struggled with divorces. And yet, reading the present-day chapters of the book, it’s very clear that something happened between them along the way, and that he screwed her over at some point.The story has everything it needs to be a juicy, delicious celebrity romance. And yet. So many things about the plot and the writing didn’t work for me. I wish I could pinpoint the exact thing that made me dislike it, but I can’t! I just found the characters so boring, and the more I read, the less I cared about them.Also, I found both the interviews to be so unbelievable! Chani just asked a handful of terrible questions each time (this even becomes an inside joke between her and Gabe) and it really bothered me that she was supposed to be an amazing writer when she didn’t seem to be very good at her job, lol.Anyway. I thought the structure of the book was also messy – one chapter is present-day, one chapter is the first interview, one chapter is a meeting they had over that last decade, one chapter is Chani’s original article, one chapter is Chani’s blog, one chapter is a random review of one of Gabe's movies... There were just so many things going on, I couldn't keep up.This was so hard to get through, I just wasn’t interested at all. Sorry, Elissa Sussman! ☹️"

I was kinda scared to read this book, because people were comparing it to Emily Henry books, which I love with my whole heart. And I was surprised because I freaking love it. The Now & After chapters, which I'm not the biggest fan of, made me unable to stop reading the book to find out what happened to the characters in the past. Also, the articles between the chapters were amazing, and the story because of them I think was even more interesting. Finally Gabe Parker is for sure in my top 5 book boyfriends for now.

461,15,Funny You Should Ask,Elissa Sussman,461,2022-04-07,Cat Moutoux,1,"I was really excited about this one & disappointed isn't even the right word for how I feel after finishing it.I initially planned to give the author some kudos in two areas:— 1) The cover is fantastic - eye-catching, interesting, & unique. Well done. The publisher probably found a great graphic designer & she made the right call by approving the design.— 2) Yeah, yeah - we've seen the impossible lovers trope, but this ultra-specific premise of a celebrity falling in love with a normie doesn't feel oversaturated in literature. Cool concept!.....until it wasn't.Unfortunately, any praise on the grounds of originality were quickly shot to hell the moment I discovered the 2011 Chris Evans GQ article by Edith Zimmerman. The similarities between Sussman's novel & Zimmerman's article are undeniable & uncomfortable. The most notable evidence includes, but is not limited to:- The casual restaurant interview over lunch, lots of beer, & banter.- Chris/Gabe are typecast as hot idiots in B-level movies but are on the brink of a make-or-break career move when they're awarded the role of Captain America/James Bond.- ""Dates"" at the red-carpet movie premiere, afterparty, & house party over the course of one weekend.- The overall portrayals, backstories, & apparent dispositions of the main characters mirror Evans & Zimmerman entirely.- The scene where she sneaks out of his house & the one where she leaves behind an item of clothing. - Meeting Chris'/Gabe's mom & finding out he's a huge mama's boy.- The general public assumes they slept together.I really wanted to believe that this was all some strange coincidence...but when I saw that this author follows both Chris Evans & Edith Zimmerman on Instagram, all my suspicions were confirmed. This explains why Chani & Gabe's relationship felt VERY surface-level & how everything else just feels like forced fluff. It's evident that Sussman struggled to fill in the gaps, as Zimmerman didn't provide her with a playbook on how to stretch a ~2,000-word magazine article into a 350-page novel. I am all for fan-fiction & drawing upon real-world inspiration, but Sussman has lost all credibility & creative integrity as an author in my eyes. I mean, at the very LEAST she could have mentioned the original GQ journalist in her acknowledgments after exploiting HER article & narrative! At most, she could have mixed up the details to make the dupe less obvious. Everything about this is icky.You can find the referenced article here: https://www.gq.com/story/chris-evans-...Aside from it being a blatant rip-off, this book just didn't work for me. I felt that way before I was privy to the aforementioned poaching. It started out cute, but the couple's insta-love after minimal encounters felt so contrived. There's a real lack of substance & the only chemistry I enjoyed was Oliver-related. The alternating timelines & various POVs were a valiant attempt to break up the book & make it fun, but they weren't done right. The execution resulted in redundancy & confusion. I didn't jive with the pacing either, as it was painfully slow and then suddenly rushed at the end with a bizarre fight/resolution. And can we please CHILL on the shitty ex-boyfriend references? That, along with the plight of female journalists was NEVER. ENDING. Like ok, we get it - now where's the actual romance? Answer: There's virtually none. The only real intimacy happens around the 90%-point & I can only describe it as store-brand vanilla at best. I rarely leave negative reviews & try to lean on constructive criticism for the author & potential readers. ""Funny You Should Ask"" is the first of its kind that I've encountered. I never thought I'd be writing a review like this. The author & her team need to seriously consider reaching out to Edith Zimmerman and/or publicly acknowledging her work as ""inspiration"" prior to release. All in all, I appreciate NetGalley & Penguin Random House for sending me this ARC e-book in exchange for my honest review."

464,15,Funny You Should Ask,Elissa Sussman,464,2022-01-23,Becca Freeman,5,"I DEVOURED this book in less than 24 hours. As an aficionado of the famous person/non-famous person romance genre, this one hit all the right notes for me without feeling stale or overly trope-y. A 26-year-old journalist is commissioned to write a profile of the actor who is cast to play the next James Bond. The piece goes viral and, despite denials from both parties, there's speculation that something romantic happened over the weekend they spent together for the interview. Ten years later, the two reunite so she can write a follow-up profile on the actor, who, after a failed marriage, public struggles with sobriety, and a verbal altercation with a director has been shunned from Hollywood. I loved the juxtaposition of the then/now timelines and thought the exploration of how the virality of the original profile both positively and negatively affected the writer was so interesting. I think this book is going to be a huge hit. If you're reading this, it's definitely worth saving/pre-ordering!"

Dear reader, I am SO glad that I did. From page one I was completely endeared to both Gabe AND Chani and this was just an all-around delight. I devoured it in one sitting because I just couldn’t get enough. It was equal parts swooney and heart-felt and I thoroughly enjoyed every moment spent between these pages. Oddly, I’ve read quite a few Hollywood-centered romances this year (some I’ve loved and some… not so much lol), and this one definitely managed to stand out amongst the crowd and I just highly, highly recommend.

470,15,Funny You Should Ask,Elissa Sussman,470,2022-04-12,Theresa Alan,3,"2.5 stars. I had a hard time getting through this. It kept putting me to sleep. A large part of the plot hinges on an alleged stereotype of female journalists sleeping with celebrities to get a story. If that’s a stereotype, it’s the first I’ve heard of it. I think of writers and journalists as more likely to be brainy and nerdy (in a good way, since I like smart, literate people) than vixens using their wiles to get a scoop. The protagonist is so defensive that even though I agreed with much of her world view, I didn’t like her. Ten years ago, Chani gets an interview with the actor Gabe Parker and ends up going to a movie premier with him, meaning she spends more time than just asking some questions over lunch or a cup of coffee. The subsequent profile she writes launches her career, and he does well for a while until his addiction to alcohol causes him to stumble. In these 10 years, they’ve both had less than successful marriages. When they’re reunited a second time, the lust everyone assumes they acted on a decade earlier has an opportunity to bloom.I got an advance copy of this from NetGalley. It RELEASES APRIL 12, 2022."

“But when you're focused on feeding something that can never truly be satiated, you miss what you're actually hungry for.”
If a book can keep me blushing and internally reprimanding myself over how single I am because I am jealous of fictional people, then I'd say that it was a phenomenal story.I haven't read a romance in a while that had me going like this. The tension between Chani and Gabe was palpable. Chani meets the heartthrob Gabe due to a piece she is commissioned to write about him and his newest movie job as James Bond. Her piece hits the stands in a whirlwind and speculation about a budding romance between the two is heard from left to right despite the many denials (and their internal desires). Everyone goes their separate ways with things left unfinished and feelings hurt. Ten years later, after life swooped them each up, Chani is again commissioned to write a follow-up piece about Gabe due to her original piece bringing soo much traction. The two finally meet once again.Both characters go through lots of changes and their character development was one of the biggest points in this book in relation to their relationship with each other. Entirely a slow burn, but the reader is never left with a dull moment. It's a lot of the ever-so-great fluff and undeniably sexy chemistry us readers are always asking for."
473,15,Funny You Should Ask,Elissa Sussman,473,2022-08-10,Karla Espinosa,4,"I adored every single moment in this book! The realness and relatability of the characters made them so likable and the reading experience that much more enjoyable. This was a story about a huge movie star and a young reporter that meet for only an interview but it turns into the most memorable weekend for both. The book starts out with them reuniting a decade later and having to face all of their very real feelings for each other even after so long. I thoroughly enjoyed this book! I feel like the ending for a book like this is so important because, after so many years of waiting and so much built-up tension that these characters go through, the ending can make or break the whole story. This ending, I will say, was absolutely perfect. "

476,15,Funny You Should Ask,Elissa Sussman,476,2022-11-23,Rachel Reads Ravenously,4," 4 stars! Taking place in the present, and ten years earlier (with a smidge of in between), this is the story of Chani and Gabe. Ten years ago, writer Chani spent three days with movie star Gabe working on a story to help his career. Ten years later the two meet again for another story and old wounds are reopened.This is one of those books where you have to tell yourself not to judge it by the cover (because to me, this book cover is truly awful) and just read it and enjoy. Second chance romance is one of my favorite tropes, and this was a good one. I don’t always love celebrity romance but this one was done really well, portraying Gabe more as a human than a star. Chani I liked for the most part, sometimes she could be a bit cringe, but I tried to give her grace with that. Normally this would have been a four star read for me, but I have one little thing that annoyed me. All of the “then” parts the characters had insane chemistry… that just wasn’t present for the “now” parts and I thought that was kind of weird. Had that been maintained I think this would be a perfect book. Overall a great read and if you love audiobooks, this one was well done in that format."
477,15,Funny You Should Ask,Elissa Sussman,477,2023-02-27,paige,5,"""It's knowing that this isn't a fantasy. It's real life.""°•*⁀➷The first moment I pictured Chris Evans was when Gabe told his puppy ""I still love you"" because how can you not immediately picture Chris getting doe eyed over dogs. I don't think I spent a single second of this book imagining anyone but Chris, truthfully. Gabe may have been the star, but Chris Evans was the whole damn sky.Yes, that is cheesy. But Chris Evans brings out the fangirl in me. He always has. He always will. You want absolute proof, here's a quote - ""Of course I had a preference. In life - in my fantasies - it was always Gabe."" Just replace Gabe with Chris and you'll have the summary of my life. From lines like that, to lines like, ""If chocolate cake had a laugh, it would be that"" how could you not immediately picture Chris' crinkly eyed, left boob grabbing, belly laugh? I have never been so easily transfixed by a love interest. Every thought Chani has links to one I have, or will have, about Chris Evans. I have never been so easily transported into a romance. And I have never been so happy to fall for one as I was to fall for Funny You Should Ask.I'm going to try and talk about the plot, but if Chris Evans comes up again, just know he is my achilles heal, and it's not entirely my fault.And that's where the mood for this review changes. Because I wasn't prepared for the seriousness of the plot inside a sweet little rom com. When the only thing you're expecting is to fall hard and fast for a love interest... it's entirely too easy to be taken off guard the way I was when sobriety became a part of the plot.We imagine our favorite celebrities to have the perfect lives. We can't deny that it's a part of the allure. How many of us grew up wondering what we might be famous for one day only to get to our 20's and realize a quiet life is much more satisfying? I know I always wanted to go to the Olympics, that my high school best friend wanted to make youtube videos to be a makeup artist, and that our dreams only got smaller as we got older. Now, my dream is to help people to love their job the way I do. Hers is to change a life in any way she can. And Chani's is to be able to support herself comfortably just through her writing.Did anyone ever think to ask Gabe about his? He tells Chani she had terrible questions, but in reality, did her questions dig too deep into the questions he didn't want to ask himself? Was he not ready to give proper answers? ""Sobriety gives me strength. The strength to face the things I wanted to hide from.""And if you ask me, all he wanted to do was hide from the reality Chani brought into his fragile fantasy. He was one of the ""lucky"" ones who got to live his dream, but the problem about dreaming when you get older is that the simplest irrational thought can shatter it. He tells her he wasn't expecting her, that she surprised him, and all I could think is that the things I love most are the ones I had no expectations for. Kind of like this book.Not only is Chani and Gabe's confusing past linking to a mysterious and exciting present, but the famous Oliver Matthias from that past becomes Ollie / best friend. His character adds to the dramatics while reminding the reader that in so many ways, celebrity is overrated and tedious. And not just for Gabe. His sobriety becomes his entire personality in a lot of ways, he even goes so far to say it informs everything he does. For Ollie, he wants the opposite. He wants his sexuality to be the one thing he isn't defined by. I love that both circumstances are a hit on celebrity while also adding so much to both of their personalities... with just a few pages of text.And some of the funniest as well, I mean: ""I was nintey-five percent sure that this wasn't sexual. That five percent, though..."" In context, I think it might be one of the funniest scenes I've ever read in my life.Elissa Sussman just kept pulling me in, kept surprising me, and now that I've turned the last page I can't think of a single way to thank her for the journey I just went on. It was like my favorite Chris Evans fanfiction brought to life. It was like my favorite dream, one that I'll never have to wake up from again. It's complimenting a mind rather than an appearance, asking the deep questions and not answering them until you actually know how to. It's comfort, and coziness, and finding a home within pages the same way Chani finds one in Montana. I never imagined I could love a rom com the way I love this one. I know I'm going to compare absolutely everything to it from now on, and not just because it was crafted because of how wonderful Chris Evans is. There's relatability to how lonely it is to have no one really know you. There's truth to addiction, and how it changes your life. How sometimes it changes your dreams as well. There's the endless, unanswerable question of, ""Where do I belong?"" and the unending certainty that a romance novel will always answer it.Chani certainly finds her place in the world. Have you?- Paige"
478,15,Funny You Should Ask,Elissa Sussman,478,2022-06-06,Brandice,3,"Alternating between Then and Now, Funny You Should Ask follows Chani Horowitz, a writer assigned to profile Gabe Parker, an actor who’s been tapped to star in the next James Bond movie. Chani spends a weekend with Gabe that includes attending a movie premiere, and delivers a profile that leaves readers with a big question about the 2 of them and also propels Chani’s writing career. Shortly after that weekend, Chani feels deeply slighted with how things unfolded. Now, a decade later, at the request of Gabe’s PR team, Chani agreed to write a follow up piece. The 2 reunite and there is a lot to catch up on. Throughout the story, in both timeframes, Chani felt very angsty for a grown woman — While everyone has doubts at least occasionally, I had a hard time believing someone who has established a decade+ career in professional writing, would stay so defensive and insecure for so long. Interspersed between the Then and Now(s) are articles from publications about Gabe’s career and love life, along with posts from Chani’s blog. For the first 70 pages I was hooked, but Funny You Should Ask lost its steam. I think both characters could have treated each other better. While I didn’t enjoy this one as much as I hoped to, it was an easy read."

480,16,Thank You for Listening,Julia Whelan,480,2023-03-27,Nilufer Ozmekik,5,"Honestly, I fell in love with author’s debut novel “My Oxford Year” and I was so excited to start this one. I saw some mixed reviews, rolling my eyes, maintaining my objectivity! Normally at first chapter I decide my semi verdict about a book. As usual I started to read this one, and I was literally guffawing. It was hilarious opening! Then a few chapters later: I was hooked and as soon as Sewanee meets Nick, I was game! I literally started drooling over! The book glued to my hands! I couldn’t stop reading it! It was smart, seductive, heartfelt, entertaining!!! Here’s the quick recap of the plot: I easily connected with Sewanee Chester: once upon a time an aspiring actress who had a terrible accident resulting with losing her one eye, wearing permanent eye patch to cover it and damaging her shoulder. She decides using her acting skills with more proficient way by narrating audibooks: and guess what? She literally kills it! She manages talking in different accents, imitating perfect male voices! Only thing she doesn’t do is romance novels! But after attending to Vegas Book Convention for replacing her boss/ her landlord/ her mentor Mark, sharing a room with her bestie Adaku who is riding movie star, living her dreams by heading to a blockbuster as leading actress, her life changes in one magical night!  When Adaku leaves her alone at the bar for catching an audition which takes place in LAX, Sewanee decides to call the night but then something magical happens which can only happen in romance novels: A perfect stranger with Irish accent and heavy charm sits on her table and begins to talk…they have only one night till the stranger called Nick leaves the town. They share a memorable night! Sewanee acts like a stranger, talking in Texan accent, giving her name as Alice the book editor! And they parted their ways! Then she does something unacceptable. For paying the expanses of nursing house of grandmother Blah ( short for Barbara :that woman stole the chapters each time she appeared on the page) , she needs extra cash, so she takes the offer she cannot refuse: she’s gonna be co-narrator of a romance novel with freaking BrockMc Night: the industries hottest, most secretive and sexiest male voice. She still tries forgetting her magical snowy one night stand in Vegas but now her sweet, steamy banters, long text messages with Brock make her hyperventilate! Should she meet the guy face to face? Absolutely! But that blind date meeting can be more earth shattering, mind blowing, jaw dropping that can ever imagine! Can you imagine a romcom meets women’s fiction is approaching all those classic cliches with sarcastic and incredibly entertaining tone with getting full of cliches! That’s the definition of the book!It is a sweet combination of romance playbook including just one night stand, epistolary, mistaken identity,love triangle ( sweet Mitzi was tough competitor) and interestingly you truly enjoy each of them!  I cannot give less than five stars! Actually if I had a chance I would give ten stars! That’s how I had a dreamy experience! Dear Julia Whelan: I became a true fan girl of your writing! I’m looking forward to read your future works as well! Special thanks to NetGalley and Avon and Harper Voyager for sharing this amazing digital reviewer copy with me in exchange my honest thoughts."
481,16,Thank You for Listening,Julia Whelan,481,2022-09-09,Ayman,4,"Julia Whelan is a fucking queen! if there's anything i'm gonna hype fixate on it’s gonna be a romance following “Mirrorball characters.” This book follows 2 audiobook narrators, Sewanee and Brock. And it’s hard to describe this book without spoiling it but basically these two become a sort of pen pals because they are recording this audiobook together and down the line they decide to meet in person and all hell breaks loose. These characters are complex and deep, and I would sell my family to protect them. The emotions and self-discovery Sewanee goes through is written authentically and realistically. We are in her 3rd pov through out the whole book and witness the complex relationships she has with family members and friends. Brock omg don’t let the name fool you, was a fucking delight. He was funny as fuck and I just feel like Julia wrote this mf for me lmaoo. Anyway, the reason it’s not getting a full 5 stars is because the pacing was kind of off and lowkey towards the last 25% I wanted it to be over already. Nonetheless, I’m glad I made it to the end because not only was it worth it but because it ended better than I thought it would."

The last thing she expects to find is a real connection with co-narrator and audiobook star Brock McNight. An utterly delightful read!"

484,16,Thank You for Listening,Julia Whelan,484,2022-10-12,MarilynW,4,"Thank You for ListeningJulia Whelan (Author/Narrator)Since I'm a fan of Julia Whelan's narrations, I definitely wanted to listen to this book that she both authored and narrated. Despite the very serious subject matters that are explored, this story is funny, too.Sewanee Chester used to be living her dream. Her life as an up and coming actress was looking better and better everyday until a tragedy slashed through her dreams and she found herself living a nightmare. It's been seven years since her tragic change of direction and now she is an audiobook narrator. Sewanee's really good at it and has made a name for herself but she isn't able to let go of the past, her regrets, her self blame, and that she will never be able to live that old dream again. In the beginning of her narrating career Sewanee narrated romance, with all the embarrassing words and sounds that go with certain scenes. But she's been able to move on from that genre to step out of the ""too much info"" of romance to narrating tamer genres. Now, Sewanee is about to hit a complicated time in her life. She has a one night stand with a charming, funny man and they didn't even exchange numbers so she will never see him again, Especially since she gave him a fake name and background. He couldn't even find her if he wanted to do so. Not long after that Sewanee agrees to co-narrate a romance novel written by a late author that she adored. The other narrator is Brock McNight, known as the male voice of romance. Getting to know this man by text, working with him without meeting him in person, Sewanee becomes aware of what she might be missing in life. Both men have her thinking about learning to accept herself as she is now and about how having a man who she really enjoys sharing with, laughs, cries, all of it, could be a thing she wants, if she could only let go of the past and the blame. The mysterious love interests are funny and made me laugh more than I want to admit. Interactions with both of them can get pretty goofy but it's good that Sewanee lets more of her inner goofiness out. She has a really good sense of humor when she can get over herself. But Sewanee has a lot on her plate. A neglectful father, a grandmother slipping farther into her dementia, jealousies she can't let go of, ""why me"" that she can let go of, and worries that this is all there is after her dreams became a nightmare. I enjoy author's notes and Julia's author's note is especially interesting to me. I like knowing stuff and she breaks down what is and isn't from her life about this story. It's fiction but she knows her subject matter and I look forward to more work from her.Pub August 2, 2022"
485,16,Thank You for Listening,Julia Whelan,485,2022-08-14,jessica,4,"theres a scene in this where the MC explains to her love interest the difference between womens fiction and romance. while both have their merits, i initially picked this book up hoping for a romance but instead got womens fiction.and as a chick-lit novel, this is good. it explores some relevant topics for adults, such as saving family relationships, forging career paths, navigating friendships, and overcoming past trauma. and its all done really well.but man, i desperately wanted more of the romance. theres just sooo much potential for sparks between two romance audiobook narrators but, sadly, its not utilised. enacting a scene together in a confined audiobooth should have been steamy, but instead it gets turned into a conversation about career goals. which yes, are important, but not as immediately important as the characters chemistry! so this didnt quite deliver in the way i wanted it to but, for the story it is, its pretty good. ↠ 4 stars"

487,16,Thank You for Listening,Julia Whelan,487,2022-08-02,Jayme,4,"When I first saw that this book was written by everyone’s FAVORITE audiobook narrator, Julia Whelan- an actress who herself now uses her acting skills to bring to life the words of many of our favorite authors- I wondered if it was autobiographical. 🤔Although that doesn’t seem to be the case, it does allow us have a glimpse, into BOTH worlds, which added an extra layer of intrigue to the story for me! It definitely shows the side of audiobook narration which isn’t as glamorous as what one would imagine, and it was fun to learn that just like acting there is A LOT of PREP WORK that goes into it-you don’t just sit down and read a book aloud!! Sewanee Chester, (Swan) named after her grandmother’s hometown, no longer believes in HEA (happily ever after).An accident which resulted in the loss of one eye, took away her dreams of becoming a film actress, and while her best friend, and fellow Actress Adaku, soared to fame-she retreated to a sound booth, getting her start narrating novels for iconic romance author, June French, using the alias, Sarah Westholme.As she developed her own following as a narrator, she gave up the romance genre, and moved on to others, but when her ailing grandmother, Blah Blah, (she couldn’t pronounce Barbara as a toddler) needed to be moved to the very expensive “memory care” wing of her assisted living home, she decides to reconsider when offered the kind of money she would need to pay for this move. June French had recently passed away, and her wish was that her LAST novel be read by “Sarah” and the hottest male narrator in the industry, Brock McNight. I loved the relationship that Swan shared with Blah Blah, as I was extremely close with my late grandmother, so this dimension added a lot to the story for me. It was also refreshing to see a strong, female friendship portrayed as well! But, it wouldn’t be a satisfying ROMANCE novel if there wasn’t chemistry between Sewanee (Sarah) and Brock. Fortunately the book DOES have the playful banter which makes these stories fun, and the HEAT 🔥 to make you want to believe in HEA! The first half was stronger for me, as the story got a little to preachy and cheesy around the 75% point-but the ending had me closing my Kindle wearing a satisfied smile. NOW AVAILABLE! Read it or LISTEN 🎧 to it narrated by Julia Whelan, herself!!A buddy read with DeAnn-be sure to check out her wonderful review! ❤️Thank You to Avon Books for the gifted ARC provided through NetGalley. It was my pleasure to offer a candid review!"
488,16,Thank You for Listening,Julia Whelan,488,2022-08-04,Sujoya ,4,"Date of Publication: 2 August, 2022!3.5⭐After a tragic accident forces Sewanee “Swan” Chester, a graduate of Juilliard and former up-and-coming actress, to forgo her dreams of an acting career, she ventures into the world of audiobook narration, a profession in which she earns repute and a respectable income. However, memories of her accident and subsequent disfigurement and her unrealized dreams cast a shadow on her present life. Initially, she gains recognition as a popular narrator of romance novels (under an assumed name) but has since moved on from the genre (she detests the unrealistic and impractical tropes and the promise of HEA in romantic novels!) to more serious books and is presently a successful audiobook narrator, under her real name. A chance meeting with a handsome stranger at a book convention in Las Vegas leads to a very interesting night for her and provides a welcome change from her monotonous life in LA.Upon returning to LA she is offered the chance to perform the last novel of a famous romance writer, who has recently passed away, with the elusive and extremely popular narrator Brock McKnight. Initially reluctant she ultimately accepts the offer as it would enable her to afford an upgrade in her grandmother’s care at a swanky retirement facility. The audiobook is scheduled to be released in episodic format and what follows is a collaboration between Swan (using her previously discarded pseudonym) and Brock, lots of humorous communication, sharing and attraction which also brings its share of tension, misunderstandings, secrets and other challenges. As the narrative progresses, we see how Swan tries to balance her personal and professional aspirations, deal with her grandmother's failing health and navigate her way through tension with both her father and her well-meaning best friend who is a successful actress trying to help Swan revive her acting career, all in an effort to move on from her disappointments and allow herself to finally be happy.Julia Whelan’s Thank You for Listening is an entertaining read with loads of heart and humor. Yes, the usual tropes (the chapters are actually named after the more common tropes in romance novels) make the story predictable ( it is a rom-com, so no surprises there), but the cast of interesting characters, their backstories, the humorous banter over emails and texts between the main characters (reminiscent of one of my favorite Meg Ryan/ Tom Hanks movies) make for an entertaining read. Though the story did drag in a few places (400+ pages is a bit too long), it still managed to hold my interest. What upped my rating (from a 3 to a 4) was the inside look into the hard work that goes into the process of audiobook narration and the challenges faced by professional narrators. Also, reading a romance novel that pokes fun at the genre and the concept of HEA, while the narrative progresses in a similar direction was an amusing experience. Many thanks to NetGalley and Avon and Harper Voyage for providing a digital review copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."
489,16,Thank You for Listening,Julia Whelan,489,2022-08-23,Anne Bogel,5,"Two audiobook narrators find love in this meta take on contemporary publishing. Romance enthusiasts always roll their eyes when critical readers mock the “predictability” of the genre. In her long-anticipated sophomore novel, top-tier narrator Whelan has a ball skewering the tired objections of romance skeptics as she takes us deep into the world of the field she knows so well. Actress-turned-narrator Sewanee is still recovering from a terrible accident that scarred her inside and out when she’s cast alongside the sexy and secretive Brock McKnight in a coveted project. Whelan clearly enjoys playing with the genre’s familiar tropes—snowed in, just one night, mistaken identity. With wittily named chapter titles (don’t miss them!) and great supporting characters, this sometimes steamy romance shows our heroine forgiving herself and finding true love.

I was over the moon excited to listen to this after seeing the rave 4-5 ⭐️ reviews on here!2. I was even more hyped that the MC Sewanee was disabled! ( being chronically ill I believe that romantic partners with disabilities should be written about WAY more often!) I am ALL FOR romances with characters that aren’t cut from a cookie cutter mold.3. I know that Julia Whelan is a beloved Audio Book Narrator & Actress. I’ve enjoyed her voice a good amount of times as well so I was intrigued!However this book was a total miss for me.A. The romance between Sewanee & Brock always seemed forced.B. I don’t think either character had a very enjoyable personality.C. The twists that come out were quite cringe (spoiler free so I’ll keep this basic & say for instance why he really approached her to begin with) “Why had he chosen her? She realized her hair had fallen forward in a way that had hidden her eye patch.”D. The back & forth banter wasn’t very humorous for me, but a bit dull.E. There were FAR too many side stories : her grandmother in the nursing home, her strained relationship with her father, her best friend’s career, her mother & stepfather’s romance, June’s backstory etc.F. In comparison with another book that I listened to about audio book narrators, “The Ex Talk” it wasn’t nearly as good. G. There were zero steamy parts IMO. 😬 H. The book was too long & repetitive. I actually sped up the last 15-20% so I could be finished. I. The odd names were very distracting Seawanee aka “Swan”, “Blah Blah,” Adaku…“The human voice is the thread that connects one soul to another. ““I don’t know when but eventually you’re gonna to have to stop thinking you’re nothing more than a damaged version of yourself.”Thank you #partners @librofm @netgalley & @harperaudio for a #gifted ALC in exchange for my honest review.

491,16,Thank You for Listening,Julia Whelan,491,2022-07-14,Rachel Reads Ravenously,4," 4 stars! After a tragic accident, Sewanee Chester has settled into a career of being an audiobook narrator and leaving behind her acting career. She started in the audiobook career reading romance, but since her success has left that genre behind. After one magical night with a stranger while at a conference, Sewanee returns home to find that she has an offer to record an audiobook with a world famous narrator, but it’s a romance and she is hesitant. This with lots of changes in her family and friends life leave Sewanee at a point of change in her life, she just has to pick which direction to go. It's funny because while this book is fiction it really seemed to me almost autobiographical in nature (which luckily author addressed at the end of the book). A former actress turned audiobook narrator? That’s Julia Whelan. But the characters are very much their own and not rooted in real life, which considering they felt real I was very impressed. My favorite parts of the book are the ones in which Sewanee spent time with her grandmother Blah, they felt the most real to me and hit me the hardest, even bringing tears into my eyes. There were complicated friend and family dynamics covered in this book that I enjoyed very much and hit home a lot. I will say, the plot of this book was fairly predictable which is why it’s a 4 and not 5 star read for me. I guessed every single plot point from the beginning of the book which did take away from my enjoyment a bit.Whelan with her second novel, gives a heartfelt story about a woman accepting her circumstances and forgiving herself for the mistakes she made leading to this point. It’s also a love letter to audiobooks and the artists who make them.  I received an ARC from the publisher via netgalley. After that I received an advanced listening copy from libro.fm as a part of their librarian ALC program. I chose to listen to the advanced copy instead of reading.

492,16,Thank You for Listening,Julia Whelan,492,2022-05-30,Christy,5,"5 stars This book made my romance loving heart so happy! I was impressed with Whelan's debut novel, My Oxford Year, and I'm glad to say that I loved Thank You for Listening just as much. A book about audiobook narrators... as someone who does a majority of her reading via audiobooks, I loved the premise of this story. Sewanee was an actress until an accident changed her path. Ever since, she's been an audiobook narrator, and a successful one at that. She's an actress at heart and that translates well into narration. While at a convention for audiobooks, she meets someone. They spend one impactful night together. But we'll get back to that later. Sewanee is one of those characters you can't help but love. She has her job, but also helps take care of her grandma. I have a soft spot for grandparents in books, and I loved their relationship. Now, back to the narration... Sewanee narrates all kinds of audiobooks, but not romance. She did at the start but hasn't in some time. Until the queen of romance gives Sewanee an offer she can't refuse. Narrating with Brock McKnight and making the money she needs to help grandma. I'm going to be a little tight lipped about the romance, because I loved how it played out and I don't want to spoil it. This had a bit of the grumpy/sunshine troupe I love so much and our hero was such a gem of a character. Every time he was on page, I had a huge smile on my face. It was serendipitous, how these two got together and fate kept bringing them back. If you love audiobooks and romance novels, you need to pick this book up. It's not just an epic love story, but it's a story of friendship, family, and self acceptance. It's witty, romantic, fun, and has so much heart. It was perfect for me and as much as I loved reading it, I can't wait to listen to it when the audiobook releases. Julia Whelan is not only a fantastic author, she's one of my favorite narrators and I know she'll knock it out of the park narrating this one! "

Sewanee starts believing that maybe falling for someone is possible until they decide to meet....I loved this one. It was so much fun listening to it. I love the couple's banter, and I thought Julia Whelan did an excellent job at fleshing out this book's characters. The same thing goes for the secondary characters.

494,16,Thank You for Listening,Julia Whelan,494,2023-02-14,Corina,4,"PERFECT narration!!! and just a wonderful romance novel. ♡ MUST READNot only is the book perfect for everyone who loves audiobooks, since both MCs are audiobook narrators, one of them is this hot, sexy, mysterious male romance narrator that everyone wants to you-know-what, and nobody knows who he is. Doesn’t that sound familiar to you?But the novel is also perfect for everyone loving this genre.It has the most wonderful banter, and it comes across as amazingly effortless. Their chemistry is full on display, and their attraction palpable. From their meet cute to them getting to know each other and lastly meeting up in real life – it just worked!! Plus the range of emotion was beautifully balanced, from lighter romance to more emotional family story, it made for a perfect combination. Low on drama and big on everything else. Just the way I like it.Seriously, it was a pleasure to listen to this audiobook. Julia Whelan did a fabulous job, as always. She is actually one narrator who does the male voices as good as any male narrator.So, if this sounds anything at all like you might like, go and grab yourself a copy. I’m sure you’ll enjoy it as much as I did.PS. The author’s note was such a great touch and answered quite a few of my questions.___________________________________I received a copy of this book from the publisher for free in exchange for an honest review.

""Eventually, don't know when but eventually, you are going to have to stop thinking you're nothing more than a damaged version of yourself.""  This entire book just hit way too hard and way too close to home in all the right places.

 One of my favorite reads of this entire year.  What an incredible, original and full-hearted read. Emotional, heart-breaking and so romantically hilarious and so unbelievably realistic.  I feel like Julia has narrated enough books by Emily Henry that they literally have the exact same prose. I dare say Julia is better at it.  This is the story of two audiobook narrators who fall in love before they really know who the other one is in real life. It had absolutely everything I love in contemporary romances. A lot of flirty texts, believable characters, a relatable, hilarious and heart-breaking female main character.  This book dealt with life in the most amazing, unique and real way. I don't think I have enough words to express how real and touching this book was. I 100% recommend the audiobook that is narrated by Julia herself. I love her narration style and honestly, she rocks her male voice.  This is one of the best book I've read this year. Totally worth the ride."
496,16,Thank You for Listening,Julia Whelan,496,2022-08-02,DeAnn,4,"4 witty banter stars - now available (and I heard will be featured on NPR today)I loved this book about an audiobook narrator. Who knows, it might even inspire me to listen to an audiobook someday! It was a fascinating glimpse into what goes into creating an audiobook, it’s not just reading out loud.Meet Sewanee Chester, she was an up-and-coming actress when a tragic accident forced her to put aside that career. She’s made a success of a career as an audiobook narrator, even though she still yearns for an acting career. She started narrating romance but has moved on to other genres. She’s caring for her sick grandmother when a startling offer comes through to narrate one last romance book from one of her favorite authors. I really enjoyed the strong relationship and connection that she has with her grandmother.This offer could make the difference in providing quality care for her grandmother, so she begins work with the elusive Brock McNight. Through the project, they begin to get to know each other although they never meet in person. Could something more develop between them?Overall, this one was an enjoyable read and I’m tempted to pick up audiobooks now!Be sure to check out Jayme's amazing review, this made for a great buddy read for us.My thanks to Avon/Harper Voyage for the copy of this one to read and review.

497,16,Thank You for Listening,Julia Whelan,497,2022-08-07,Elyse Walters,5,"Audiobook….read by Julia Whelan ….11hours and 16 minutesI enjoyed “My Oxford Years” years ago—but even more, I’ve grown to ‘adore’Julia Whelan’s…. immediately familiar voice…. …..for the many books that she’s narrated — that I’ve loved. As soon as I saw this title …“Thank You for Listening”…..I was interested and intrigued…..But then I said to myself…. “Wait! A *NOVEL*… huh? How can that be?” I had seen ‘nothing’ about this book — until I did…..not on Goodreads either. ( guess I’m becoming an aging slow turtle asleep under a rock)….But…I quickly purchased it and went in blind. I was secretly hoping this was a memoir to be honest….I mean just the title had me talking back to Julia: “I do! I ‘do’ thank you, Julia, for reading many very enjoyable books. It would be my deepest pleasure to hear about your experiences as a voice narrator”…… “I mean you’re the AUDIOBOOK READER FEMALE QUEEN!” but … it’s a novel (ha, so the book says)….utterly enjoyable too…. ….clever in that she weaves other romance novels -romcoms - into this story. Although I wouldn’t categorize ‘this’ book as a simply a romcom…..its more broad-range that that. SMART…..heartwarming enjoyable. It’s laugh out loud hilarious in ‘parts’…..and a few sad parts too … …what added a deeper personal satisfaction for me was Julia’s author notes. You have to read the book first to appreciate her notes. 1 + 1 = 2Julia Whelan reading a novel + reading a novel she wrote = LOVE"

500,16,Thank You for Listening,Julia Whelan,500,2022-07-25,Jessica J.,3,"A few weeks ago, I got together with my Any Book Book Club (where instead of reading and discussing the same book, we just talk about what we've been reading lately - it's brilliant and everyone should do this) and we got into a discussion about books that are marketed as romance novels and have all the hallmarks of romance novels (ie, the Happily Ever After) but do not feel like romance novels because the ""couple falling in love"" part of the story doesn't feel like the most important thing happening. The topic came up because one woman felt like the book she'd read wasn't a romance novel because it focused too heavily on the protagonist's relationship with her sister; I'd felt like the plot with the sister was secondary to the romance with the handsome fella. But it also got me thinking because I'd also recently read a book that was marketed as a romance novel but whose primary emotional core came from the protagonist's relationship with her sister. And funny enough, that same basic theme came up again in Thank You For Listening, which was a romance novel that fell short of my expectations because the love story wasn't the primary focus. Full circle, y'all. I think it's safe to say that Julia Whelan is everyone's favorite audiobook narrator. Which makes sense, because she's great. She narrates a ton of books each year, but she might be most well-known for her romance and ""women's fiction"" catalog. So of course it makes sense that she would pen a romance novel(ish) about a woman who makes her living as an audiobook narrator. Write what you know, eh? Sewanee Chester is the protagonist here. She and her friend Adaku both aspired to be actresses; while Adaku's career has taken off like a rocket, an accident left Sewanee with a career-altering injury and she has turned to audiobooks instead. She built her career on narrating romance novels but she grew weary of the genre in recent years and has shifted her focus elsewhere. As the novel opens, Sewanee is attending a BookCon-style convention at the behest of her boss/landlord. When Adaku bails on a girl's night out in Vegas, Sewanee finds herself flirting with a hot Irishman at the bar. Sewanee gives him a fake name and backstory, but one thing leads to another and the two share a single, steamy night together. Fast forward a couple of months and Sewanee receives a proposal: one of the most beloved romance authors in the world has passed away and she wanted Sewanee to narrate her final book with Brock McNight, the secretive pseudonymous male narrator who is undoubtedly the biggest name in romance audiobooks. Sewanee is hesitant, but the proposal comes with a huge paycheck. Sewanee needs that money in order to pay for her grandmother's transfer to a dementia unit in a senior care facility, so she eventually agrees to narrate the book under her own pseudonym (who knew so many narrators don't use their real names!?) As they get to work on the book, Sewanee and Brock begin exchanging emails and eventually texts. At first, it's all about the logistics of their work, but there's a real flirty vibe between the two of them and Sewane finds herself revealing parts of herself she's been hesitant to share with anyone else. It all forces her to be honest with herself about the reasons that she pulled back from so many things in her life. And, I don't know. The behind-the-scenes details of the audiobook world were truly fascinating and Julia Whelan has written some great chemistry between Brock and Sewanee, but there are honestly just too many other threads going on in this story. Sewanee has conflict with her father over her grandmother's deteriorating state, conflict with Adaku over her acting career, self-confidence issues pertaining to her injury, turmoil because her boss might be ready to close down the audiobook production company, an encounter with an ex that leaves her feeling shaken, and she's trying to sort out her feelings about this man whose real name she doesn't know. Because there's so much going on, it doesn't feel like any of these issues are really explored with the kind of depth they deserve and the resolutions to these various storylines don't always feel earned. I think that's why it ended up feeling less like a romance novel than a novel about a woman going through some shit who just happens to catch feelings for a dude along the way. Maybe that was Julia's Whelan's goal? I'm not sure. It's definitely marketed as a romance novel, but the characters do spend a not-insignificant amount of time debating the difference between romance and ""women's fiction"" (I think we can all agree that's a stupid term, right!?) so I do think she wanted to at least explore the limits of genre with this one. Maybe if she had just narrowed her focus just a little bit and trimmed some of the plot threads that didn't really feel so vital to Sewanee's journey of self-enlightenment, I might have enjoyed this more. As it is, though, I found Thank You For Listening to be just very run-of-the mill."
501,16,Thank You for Listening,Julia Whelan,501,2022-07-16,Maren’s Reads,5,"Read if you like:⬗ Witty banter ⬗ Mistaken Identity ⬗ Women’s Fiction ⬗ Audiobooks 4.5★Thoughts: I have only listened to one audiobook narrated by the treasured Julia Whelan, but I was intrigued when I saw she had written several of her own, including this upcoming release, Thank You For Listening. Although I was tempted to read it on my kindle, as I do with many ARCs, I opted to listen to her narrate her own story on audiobook. And I think listening to this one on audio took it up a notch for me. Listening to her multitude of tones and accents was as impressive to me as the story itself, if not more so. I enjoyed getting the inside look at the world of audiobook narration, a story within a story if you will, and the process that goes along with making a book come to life via narration. I also really liked the way Whelan developed her characters, including even her supporting characters. I absolutely loved learning about Sewanee’s grandmother Blah Blah, her sparkling sense of humor, her rich past and the connection she has to her granddaughter. While predictable, I adored the relationship between Sewanee and Brock, in the many forms it takes on. Filled with more swoon worthy moments than I can count, I was utterly charmed by Brock and his inability to see anything but her internal beauty (*sigh*). For a deep and heartfelt rom-com with as much com as rom, look no further than Thank You For Listening. And if you can, check it out on audio to hear Whelan in all of her glory. Thank you to Libro.fm and Avon Books for an ALC in exchange for my honest review. "
502,16,Thank You for Listening,Julia Whelan,502,2022-09-19,Blaine,5,"Now, that was a smile. It rendered the cheesy line charming. Oh, God. Swan wasn't ready for this, this lanky-limbed, broad-shouldered, tanned wrinkles at the corners of his eyes, 8 o'clock shadowed, tall, iced umbrella cocktail of a man.…I was a fearless boy who became a fearful man.…We break, in many different ways, but it doesn’t mean we’re broken.The Goodreads description for Thank You for Listening is an excellent summary of the plot, so I won’t bother with my own recap. And that’s nice, because it allows me more space to gush about how great this novel is.The story in Thank You for Listening worked for me on every level. The banter and dialogue is snappy and almost too perfect, but the content, the subjects, and the feelings being discussed are completely true to life. The story has humor throughout (including a wickedly funny opening scene). The romance is a realistic one—and puts a meta spin on several romance novel tropes along the way—with occasional sex scenes that are hot without being particularly explicit.That alone would be enough to recommend a book, right? But Thank You for Listening brings so much more to the table. There is a great deal of non-romance content, and it packs an emotional punch. The entire storyline involving Sewanee and her father disagreeing over how to best care for her grandmother as she fights her losing battle with dementia. Sewanee’s backstory, and her struggle to accept and move on from the accident that changed the direction of her life. The stories within the novel about the fictional romance writer June French and the final project she wrote for Sewanee to help narrate. These counterbalancing plot lines give the book real stakes, and create joy and sadness and genuine emotion. Finally, as an avid audiobook listener (who also knows that Julia Whalen is one of the best narrators around), I thought setting this story in the world of audiobook narration and seeing the behind the scenes work it takes to record an audiobook was really fun. Relatively early in Thank You for Listening Sewanee explains to Nick the purported differences between women’s fiction—“usually written by women about … life. You can win, you can lose, you can die. You know, real human things universal to everyone”—and romance, which has two general requirements: a happy ending, and it has to be about people falling in love, usually with on-page sex. Of course, Sewanee and Julia Whalen are in on the joke that these divisions are just dismissive, sexist nonsense. Women’s fiction is just … fiction about real human things universal to everyone, and some of those things are going to be romantic (and hopefully a bit on-page smutty from time to time 😄😈). Part of the brilliance of this novel is how well it blurs the lines between this false division, so that you won’t know until the final pages whether you’ve been reading so-called women’s fiction, romance, or a hybrid of the two. A great novel. Highly recommended.P.S. Obviously, the best way to read this book is by listening to the audiobook, performed brilliantly by Ms. Whalen herself. You will not be disappointed."
503,16,Thank You for Listening,Julia Whelan,503,2022-08-30,Sam (AMNReader),2,"Look. Metatextual novels(someone correct me if I've got this wrong...) are truly hard to pull off. I tend to be hella put off by them, especially those that are brash,out in the open commentary of a genre, its fans, and the grit of audiobook producing. So this is a layered metatextual experience that well, frankly, lacks nuance.Am I defensive? Hell yes, I'm defensive of the fact that many, many authors deploy their criticisms at romance and seek to destroy that which is problematic by unmooring romance conventions subtly, beautifully, and effectively. They do it with their characters, with a line that nods to us with those same feelings, with an unexpected twist with the plot, scene, or interaction.But this felt like being pummeled AND nudged all at the same time. Like ""we love romance but also it's stupid and we're too good for it"" Simultaneously congratulatory and outsider. A distinct line between ""good"" romance and, well, that other stuff. And I think all of this affected my enjoyment. I was never ""in"" this with Sewanee. I was never rooting for the couple. I found her criticism of Brock, doing a job he hated, frustrating as all hell. And I'm looking at the time and seeing I've got TWO hours left. Do I care? I don't feel like I care. The conflict was super annoying and now I am just so ugh. (DNF, 85% BC I keep my promises)""Swan, this ain't goodnight moon"" ""Right, but you are""... WHAT? THE? Fuck? does this meanMy flist loves this book. I have other issues, one of them that I listened (bc of course) and I don't love the way epistolary/ text translates here. I found Whelan's writing all at once overly ambitious, choppy, and devoid of the consistent rhythm that I need in audio format. This was utterly fascinating to me, given Whelan is an actor and narrator. I understand the deployment of short, action-oriented sentences in certain recollections of this novel, but they were not pleasurable nor evocative for me, they were just there: unvaried, heavy, and, blunt. I also struggled with character, and part of me doesn't know why - although I bet it's basically the first paragraph of this review. Structurally, I also questioned the way this book was pieced together. Why scenes are dropped and picked up later, just didn't work.I know Whelan is amazing but there's also another meta-element I kinda hated. We're constantly reminded of Sewanee's acting ability, how talented she is. So listening to the audio really was a struggle to lose myself in-constantly reminded about the process etc. That's me, nobody else felt that way, but my emotions were at 10,000 feet and absolutely never in the moment. Like, oh right, this whole thing is acting. There she's acting, here she's acting... Everywhere acting. Sewanee lost her absolute shit on her optimistic, lovely BFF bc she was still beautiful and perfect. She'll never understand how difficult it's been for Sewanee. And yeah, like her face was her commodity and all that, so she's bitter, and also capitulated (no judgement here just fucking true) to the standards of beauty as exist in Hollywood. But, Lord, she's gone off at her Nigerian best friend, also an actor -- on the standards of beauty in Hollywood-- and I know this might be a character being her character but I wouldn't have been mad if Adaku would've said fuck you forever. Instead, she supports her and they move on and acts perfectly... absolutely no issue or comment (other than on her name) with all the multiple micro aggressions leveled at her in this book. I really struggled with the divergence between what I still see as Sewanee's endless privilege and her repressed feelings about her disfigurement and the failure to reconcile herself to the two. Often it was human, but it was comes across as self-indulgent in this read.Which leads me to my last issue. It was overly ambitious, unfocused, and lengthy. This is me, complaining about that ""full picture"" feel while simultaneously missing those epic romance feels like we had in lengthy romances 30 years ago and also complaining that one attempted to accomplish that. We contain multitudes."

It delivered absolutely everything I look for in romance, the range of emotions I experienced was wild! The humor, the wit, the innuendos, the A + secondary cast, the romance genre references (and jabs!), the epistolary premise (HEART), the slow burn, the heat, the absolute chemistry between two cynicals getting the HEA they both sarcastically mocked and declared unrealistic expectation! AHAH!You know how with the grumpy/sunshine dynamic we love to witness the grump do things only & ONLY for their sun? Cynical love interest is twice the reward, we get to see them both light up at all the little things they thought weren't for them or had stop believing in. 🤌🏼💋Julia Whelan most definitely understood the assignment!(CW: Death of a grandparent (important secondary character), memory loss, recount of heroine's tragic accident. The way the heroine is dealing with her grandmother memory loss (parkinson or just old age, I admit I'm uneducated on the topic) was heartbreaking at times. I loved Blah's character so much I felt her loss deeply and didn't expect her her death. Review closer to release date (or when I have more time)—————————EPISTOLARY EVERYTHING is my motto.Just look at this adorable romance plot line : Two audiobook narrators fall in love performing a dual narration for a romance. Desillusioned by romance, a former actress turned narrator reluctantly consent to work with the industry's hottest and secretive male voice on a beloved romance author latest release.I loved Julia Whelan's My Oxford Year, so ready to read more from her with Thank You For Listening

505,16,Thank You for Listening,Julia Whelan,505,2022-08-10,Mary,5,"There are some books that give you all the feels, and then there are others that GIVE YOU ALL THE FEELS, and for me that is Thank You for Listening by Julia Whelan. She narrates her own audiobook (I mean why wouldn't she), and I think you should for sure listen to this in order to get the full experience. She is my favorite narrator, and now I know she is going to be one of my favorite authors as well. I was laughing one minute and crying the next, and this took me on a ride of emotions like no other. I loved every single one of her characters, and while I know the story offers just a tiny taste of what it's like to be an audiobook narrator, I couldn't have been more fascinated. There is really a ton of work that goes into it that I hadn't thought of and being that Whelan is so good at what she does, I'm sure she does her due diligence just like our MC Sewanee.Besides all of the audiobook greatness that permeated this read, I loved Sewanee's grandma and the ladies at her care home the most. The voices Whelan created for each of her characters, not just them, were spot on and amazing, and she still does the best male voice of any narrator I've heard. Thank You for Listening also runs the gamut when it comes to different tropes packed into one book, and I thought it was a nice touch the way Whelan acknowledges that. I felt very seen when they mention readers who listen at 3x speed as well and nuggets like that permeate the entire story. There is also a great section after the book titled ""On Autobiography"", and I was very glad she included that part in the audio as well. Make sure you don't miss that or this gem of a book that is romance but so much more. If you don't love straight-up romance, Thank You for Listening is a great choice since it's about a whole lot more than that. Now if only I could be friends with Whelan... Thank you to the publishers for my advanced listening and reader copies of this book. All opinions and thoughts are my own."
506,16,Thank You for Listening,Julia Whelan,506,2023-01-20,Syndi,5,"Thank You for Listening is really a good book. This is my first read by Miss Whelan. The story is packs with so much empowerment message. Such as family, equal opportunity between sexes, and happy ending. Lets not forget the happen ending. Sweeney is such a strong heroine. Her meltdown os real struggle that I can relate too. The writing is also good. Engaging and smart. 5 stars"
507,16,Thank You for Listening,Julia Whelan,507,2023-02-20,Meags,5,"5 StarsNuanced characters, exquisite banter, fantastic support cast, secondary plot lines and backstories that I actually give a damn about, and the presence of so many favourite tropes utilised to perfection, Thank You for Listening is easily among the top-tier of my romance reading experiences of the past few years.Set in the world of audiobook narrating, the story follows aspiring-actress-turned-audiobook-legend, Sewanee Chester, as she finds herself simultaneously dealing with the rapidly declining health of an aging loved one, while also doing something she swore she’d never do again: narrate a romance book. Sewanee doesn’t like the world of romance anymore, for a multitude of deeply personal reasons (that are expertly revealed as the story unfolds), but she can’t turn down the big pay check that comes with this latest offer—to co-narrate an old friend’s final posthumous audiobook. It’s just another job, and Sewanee, ever the professional, knows what to expect and how to get it done. But what she can’t have expected is the profound connection she forms with co-narrator and all around rock star of the male voice acting world, Brock McNight. Although they’re recording from opposite sides of the country, Sewanee and Brock’s communication grows from work related to friendly to romantically entangled, and before either of them knows what’s hit them, they realise theirs might be a connection worth pursuing beyond the job. I loved every fricken element of this story. I was totally fascinated by the vivid “behind-the-curtain” look at the narrating world, which was all the more realistic considering the author herself is a legend in the audiobook industry. I relished the exploration of the world of romance and the way these characters discussed beloved tropes and character motivations the way we, the readers, discuss such things in our most favourite conversations with likeminded friends. The characters felt genuine, real—like they were versions of myself or people I know intimately. The romance was an absolute ripper, which I say EVEN THOUGH this was practically non-explicit. Did I care? Not really! Because although there was nothing graphic shown between Sewanee and Brock, this entire book oozed sexual tension and sensuality. There were scenes where they were finally face-to-face and co-narrating sex scenes together in a sound booth, and HOLY SHIT it was some of the sexiest moments I’ve read in years. It mattered little to me that they were fully dressed and simply using their voices at the time, I was completely enthralled! To me, it was a genius choice on the authors behalf, probably because she knows first-hand the power of a well-narrated sex scene. Julia Whelan has always been an exceptional audiobook narrator, standing out as a class of her own amongst her narrating peers, and now, as an author of her own romance novels, she’s a god damn force to be reckoned with! I can’t wait to read what she writes next.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! ❤️"
508,16,Thank You for Listening,Julia Whelan,508,2022-12-13,Amina,4,"An actual audiobook narrator writing a fictional story about an audiobook narrator with a little romance, a little heartache, and enough drama to keep me intrigued--sign me up!I did a little digging, and found that author Julia Whelan, his an audiobook narrator for one of my favorite authors, Taylor Jenkins. What a treat!When I requested Thank You for Listening from Libby, I got the audio and actual book. I wanted to hear the author's voice--she's fabulous. She can do an Irish male voice better than a Irish male. Seriously!This is the story of Sawanee Chester (love the name), with dreams of becoming an actor that was shattered when she had an eye injury. Instead, she enters a soundbooth and becomes a top audio narrator, mostly for romance novels. When Sawanee decides to leave the world of romance, not buying the HEA hype, she dabbles in other novels. At a convention in Vegas, she meets a stranger, has an amazing night.

A stunningly average woman the wrong side of thirty on her way to Vegas, wearing an eye patch, sitting in a broken seat, listening to porn"". 

When Sawanee is given the opportunity to return, once last time to the romance genre (a dying wish of a author) she decides to do it--the money will help support her loving grandmother, that she wants to take care of--when no one else is...The shock, Sawanee is narrating with none other then Brock McNight (don't let this adult showstopping name fool you), the infamous, sexy voice of many beloved romances. Brock and Sawanee form a bond behind the comfort of their respective sound rooms. On this journey, Sawanee discovers the pain of her past, the parts that are holding her back, and learning to cherish all that's important. 

""Spoiler alert: life is regret, life is failure. But like that ghost, you learn to live with it. Because failure makes success matter""

I enjoyed Thank you for Listening. The banter, especially in the beginning was wonderful. I was all in. The story drags a bit in the middle, there were times I was ready for the story to finish. Even though, like most rom-coms, the story is predictable, it was a great ride. 4/5 stars"
509,16,Thank You for Listening,Julia Whelan,509,2022-08-16,Brandice,4,"The Queen of Audiobooks delivered with her own second book, Thank You for Listening and of course, I highly recommend listening to the story so you can hear the expert at work! Sewanee Chester is a former actress turned audiobook narrator after an accident changed her life, and her looks. She’s great at her job which allows her to stay close by her grandmother who is increasingly needing more care. Sewanee reluctantly agrees to attend a book convention in Las Vegas and while there, meets a handsome stranger who she spends a fun night with. Once Sewanee is back home in LA, she focuses on her next project, co-narrating a romance book under her previous pseudonym with Brock McKnight, the mystery man narrator readers can’t get enough of. The two communicate digitally, talking about the book, happily ever afters, and as time goes on, get to know each other a bit better. When they discuss finally meeting up in person, Sewanee is forced to confront fears and feelings she’s hidden for a long time. As she works through this, she’s thrown for a loop when other information is revealed too. I don’t always think romcoms are actually funny but this one delivered. Despite Sewanee and Julia sharing career paths, Thank You for Listening is not autobiographical, but it’s still one you shouldn’t miss, a fun and cute story!"

I honestly couldn’t get into the first book of the series and connected with the main characters so easily but quirky, fiery, smart cousin Gwyn was so much likable supporting character and thankfully her own book was so swoon worthy, entertaining enemies to lovers theme! This second book is anything I need: it’s passionate, funny, gripping, action packed, witty! Rule follower, extra polished, a remarkable uptight gentleman and elder brother of Penhallows; Wells strikingly charming Penhallow decides to move to Graves Glen to open his own store after the failure of family pub in Wales. Interestingly his father Simon supported his decision, warning him about Jones women who stole their patriarchal powers and magical throne! He still doesn’t give his blessing to youngest son Rhys and Vivi Jones’ marriage. Gwyn: owner of Something Wicked, mentoring her three baby witches with her wisdom is not happy to see another Penhallow brother moves back to their town. She’s a grudge holder. She already knows extra pretentious tendencies from the college. She already pissed him off because he wasn’t brave enough to attend his brother’s wedding by going against his father’s wishes!And his dare to open a shop selling same kind of non magical witchery stuff across the street with promotional cup of tea makes Gwyn even more frustrated!The man keeps pushing her buttons and when she confronts him at his store’s attic, accidentally a box of sex magicked up pink spell pours down on them. As a result they find them kissing each other passionately.

515,17,The Kiss Curse,Erin Sterling,515,2022-10-19,Barbara,3,"After reading all the glorious reviews involving author Erin Sterling’s “The Ex Hex” I decided to get on this October “witchy” read bandwagon. I got the audio of her new novel “The Kiss Curse”. It started slow for me, but thank The Goddess it improved.This is a silly rom/com with magical and witchy embellishment. There are competing magic shops, spells, witchery and a bit of black magic in the town of Gravesglen.This story is a bit “steamy” in places. A bit too steamy for me, but not a distraction. It’s a cute story that takes place in October right before Halloween. It got me in the mood, so of…The audible audio is. Narrated by Shannon McManus. "

The Kiss Curse
 follows Gwyn, the beloved, quirky, and snappy cousin of Vivi from the predecessor book, The Ex Hex. We are given a cute, cozy, and a lil' steamy—enemies to lovers romance, admiring teenage witches, and an unknown mysterious energy to uncover. (Oh and Sir Purrcival is THE moment.)Due to Graves Glen having a change in the flow of power, many new witches have gathered in the town. Encountering these weird energies and emanating magic is cause for lookout into the safety of the town's magic.
""Graves Glen was a collection of lights glimmering in the darkness, homey and warm but far away, shadowy hills rising all around it.
Gwyn is running Something Wicked on her own when it just so happens, Wells, Rhys' older brother, and Gwyn's long-time enemy opens a shop across the street rivaling her store. With cause for competition, these two start to have more one-on-one run-ins creating the all too good banter and magnetism to the other. When an old university acquaintance moves to Graves Glen and invites them both to a housewarming witches-only party that radiates evil magic, the two team up to figure out just why she moved back.We are given mouthwatering tension, skin-warming fluff, and abs-inducing humor along with an intriguing and fun plot that has the reader on their toes.Provided by Avon & Harper Voyager. This will be published September 20, 2022!"
517,17,The Kiss Curse,Erin Sterling,517,2022-09-16,Maren’s Reads,4,"Of the two books in the series, I think I preferred this one. Gwyn is such a fun character, and after enjoying her role as a sidekick in book one, I was glad to see her have her own moment to shine as the star of book two. Having already experienced the town of Graves Glen, I was excited to head back and see what new trouble awaited our crew of witches. In the Kiss Curse, we have the fun angle of competing stores, when a familiar face returns to town and sets up shop across the street from Gwyn’s. Their fiery chemistry mixed with their competitive natures made Gywn and Wells such a treat to read about. And I loved the way they turned to one another, when trouble was afoot. All in all, it was the perfect mix of romance and adventure. While the supernatural element is lost on me, the overall romance and sense of small town charm was not. I will keep both of these in my rotation for Halloween reads. Thank you to Avon Books for the ARC of The Kiss Curse in exchange for my honest review. Available on September 20. 3.5★ rounded up. "

519,17,The Kiss Curse,Erin Sterling,519,2022-09-20,Blaine,4,"Update 9/20/22: Reposting my review to celebrate that today is publication day!Gwyn had no doubt that whoever he was, his ancestors had absolutely once stared down the business end of a guillotine.You didn’t get cheekbones like that without oppressing some peasants.…“You know what I mean. This is a witchy shop. I run a witchy shop. You are stepping on my turf.”“Is this where we begin snapping our fingers and launch into a dance battle?”Thanks to NetGalley and Avon/Harper Voyager for sending me an ARC of The Kiss Curse in exchange for an honest review.It’s a year after  The Ex Hex, and it’s the Jones family’s magic that now fuels Graves Glen, so the Joneses are now responsible for protecting it. And after playing the classic role of snarky best friend/cousin in the first book, Gwyn Jones is now front and center, with newly married Vivi is relegated to a minor supporting role here.Gwyn is perfectly happy with her life, being with her family, running her touristy witchcraft shop, and beginning to mentor to a group of three “Baby Witches” who want to learn more than what their school will teach. She’s even ok with her cousin Vivi’s new husband, Rhys, even if she thinks his father Simon is a jerk and thinks his brother Wells is an even bigger jerk for not coming to Vivi and Rhys’s wedding. So Gwyn is unprepared for the day that Wells Penhallow returns to Graves Glen, announces that he’s staying permanently, and then opens up a more upscale witchcraft shop right across the street from hers. And she could deal with all that, even the fact that she’s attracted to this gorgeous jerk-who’s-maybe-not-a-jerk-after-all. But Morgan, a witch with a mysterious past who Gwyn went to school with, has also just returned to Graves Glen. And at the same time all of this is happening, Gwyn begins to lose her magical powers….The Kiss Curse was written under a pen name by Rachel Hawkins, author of the very good thriller  Reckless Girls, and her writing skills again show here. But, as with  The Ex Hex, this book is a light, fun read. There is a bit of drama, but it’s relatively brief and resolved quickly (though leaving open room for more books in this series). Instead, this book is all about the funny- provided largely by the “Baby Witches”—and the budding enemies/rivals to lovers romance between Gwyn and Wells, whose bantering and hijinks also provides quite a bit of humor. The chemistry between Gwyn and Wells is again well done. And while there are a couple of sweaty scenes, the book is again more thirsty than steamy. Still, another enjoyable story, and I’ll be on the lookout for the next book in the series. 3.5 stars rounded up to 4."

521,17,The Kiss Curse,Erin Sterling,521,2022-10-04,Natasha  Leighton ,5,"Erin Sterling returns to the cozy, halloween obsessed small town Graves Glen for her Witchy, swoon-worthy and utterly addictive sequel to the rom-com TikTok sensation, The Ex Hex. If you loved The Gilmore Girls or Sabrina The Teenage Witch It follows Gwyn Jones who is perfectly happy with her life in Graves Glen. She’s formed a powerful new coven with her family; she’s running a successful witch shop called Something Wicked and she’s even mentoring some of the town’s younger witches. There’s only one problem—Llewellyn ‘Wells’ Penhallow. Wells has come to Graves Glen for two reasons—to reestablish his family’s connection with the town and to finally make a new life for himself away from his father. But, after opening a magic shop just across the road from Gwyn’s, he quickly realises that going up against her won’t be as easy as he initially thought…especially after an accidental, magic inspired (and very hot) kiss. And though Gwyn and Wells are fully committed to their witchy rivalry, they find themselves thrown together when they have to deal with the sudden appearance of a mysterious new coven and Gwyn’s concern that something—or someone—is messing with her magic…The Ex Hex was one of my fave reads last year so I was soo unbelievably excited to get the opportunity to review The Kiss Curse. And honestly, it lived up to all my expectations! It’s witchy, sexy and full of flirtatious banter I couldn’t get enough of. I loved returning to Graves Glen and seeing Vivi and Rhys again, but I have to admit Gwyn was definitely a one of my fave characters in The Ex Hex and I’m glad she finally got her own book. Gwyn is a snarky and delightfully witty protagonist that I absolutely adored and her chemistry with Wells was incredible. Likewise, Wells—Rhys Penhallow’s stern and serious older brother was a really sweet, secret cinnamon roll of a character whose attraction and subsequent feelings for Gwyn melt his standoffish barriers and make Wells reevaluate his relationship with his father, who very much despises the Jones women. I’m a sucker for enemies/rivals to lovers and GrumpyxSunshine tropes so I loved every glorious second of Gwyn and Wells’ flirty, tension filled rivalry—and their antics in trying to outdo one another was just soo humorous! I really enjoyed the supporting cast, especially the baby witches who Gwyn mentors (I’m hoping we’ll see more of them in future preferably alongside Bowen, Rhys and Wells’ other brother) but my absolute fave has to be Gwyn’s treat-loving, talking cat, Sir Purrcival who’s even more hilarious than he was in The Ex Hex.There are some really enjoyable steamy scenes (particularly the pickup truck scene) so do bear this in mind if you prefer closed door/ clean romances. Overall, an exceptionally entertaining and enjoyable witchy romance full of talking cats, intriguingly magic mysteries and loveable characters that will have to racing through this spellbindingly swoon-worthy read. A huge thank you to Headline Eternal and Netgalley for the e-arc."
522,17,The Kiss Curse,Erin Sterling,522,2022-11-08,Angie Cox,4,"3.5 ⭐️ A fun, light-hearted witchy rom-com! I haven't read The Ex-Hex, but if it's as cute as this story, I may have to add it to my October TBR. UPDATE: My review of The Ex Hex -WHAT TO EXPECT:✨ witches and magic✨ sassy, capable heroine✨ broody, soft hero✨ small town romance ✨ rivals to lovers✨ LGBTQ rep✨ banter✨ mystery✨ magical mayhem
What I liked:
Gwyn and Wells. I really enjoyed their characters. Gwyn is free-spirited, outspoken, and caring, while Wells is broody, serious, and loyal. He's hard to crack, but once Gwyn does, he's nothing but a soft-hearted simp. The banter. Gwyn is sassy as hell, and Wells can dish it back but usually in a very posh manner, making their interactions very entertaining. Their tension definitely added to the romance.""Gwyn had never thought of herself as a violent woman, but maybe, just maaaaybe, this man needed a good crack upside the head.""The small town setting. Someone mentioned on social media that this is like a magical Gilmore Girls, and I 100% agree! Graves Glen is basically Stars Hollow. This small town setting is incredibly charming and cozy that you'll want to curl up on the couch with some hot chocolate and a fuzzy blanket while diving into this adorable rom-com. 
What didn't work:
If you haven't read The Ex-Hex, you may feel a little disjointed at first. There was a bit of info dumping in the first two chapters because we needed to be brought up to speed with the events and characters in book 1. But once that was out of the way, it was smooth sailing. The conflict really starts to happen around 85% of the book. The main focus of the story is the romance, so there wasn't as much setup for the conflict. And by the time it's starting to unfold, the story ends. This was a really low-stakes romance when it could have easily had a little more plot.Gwyn getting her powers back with zero explanation as to why. What was up with that? She was just so powerful she broke the curse on her own? I really would have liked some answers. The bit about Wells' crushing on a girl with purple hair in college (Gwyn) was weird. How did he not know it was Gwyn? They go to a tiny college with an even smaller percentage of witches. Plus, they were in the same year! And once Wells tells Gwyn he had a crush on this 'purple-haired woman,' she doesn't even tell him that it's her. And then, the flashback of them in college (when she had purple hair) at the beginning didn't have any sort of significance besides showing us how irritated Gwyn was with Wells for setting up the ""rivals-to-lovers"" trope. It was a weak plot point. Overall, this was a sweet rom-com that's perfect for reading during the fall season.Thank you Harper Collins and Avon Books for providing an ARC copy in exchange for an honest review! As always, all opinions are my own."

Her and Well's are fantastic and Sir Purcivil really is the star of the show. The Baby Witches are also outstanding. I loved the Supernatural reference and found myself cracking up with laughter through a lot of this book. I really do hope there are more books from Graves Glenn as I adore this town. Kind of hoping we might get a book from Bowen. Massive 5 stars from me, perfect autumn witchy read."

First off, it goes without saying that Sir Purrcival 🐈‍⬛ was the obvious star of this book…as he should be! ☺️In this instalment of the Ex Hex 🧙‍♀️ series, we follow Gwyn - Vivi’s cousin - and Wells - Rhys’ brother. And as the owners of rival magic shops across the street from each other, the rivals-to-lovers trope provided wonderfully hilarious entertainment here, including the Baby Witches! 🥰My only critique from the previous book was the romance, which was much improved in this instalment! Vivi and Wells had me *swooning*! 😍 Gwyn’s sassy and rebellious streak perfectly balanced out Wells’ broody and reserved demeanour. Here’s to hoping we’ll get a third book following the third brother, Bowen, next Halloween! 😁🤞🏻 In fact, I’ll take a book for every person living in Graves Glen. I adore the Halloweentown 👻 and Gilmore Girls 🍂 vibes so much, and don’t want them to end!"

The series is about witches living in a charming small town, dealing with magic going haywire around them while maneuvering around their romance feels, it's almost like a Hocus Pocus/The Vampire Diaries minus the vamps.

There's no doubt that it was a fun and humorous romance full of yearning and magic that definitely didn't take itself too seriously. I wish at times there was more of a concise plot but the vibes were immaculate and ultimately carried the story for me.3.5/5"
535,17,The Kiss Curse,Erin Sterling,535,2022-09-20,Angela Staudt,5,"This is the perfect fall romance book and no one can tell me differently. I adored Gwyn from The Ex Hex and was so excited to know we were getting a whole book about her. She is full of sass and knows what she wants in life. She is so protective of the people she loves and I just love her spunk.She is running her families store when Rhys older brother, Wells, comes into town and sets up a similar store right across the street. She has a lot of hate in her heart for Wells and is extremely mad that he decided to do this. The enemies to lovers in this book goes hard and is *chefs kiss* amazing. I adore Wells and the witty banter between the two is phenomenal.While they're both getting ready for Halloween something sinister is going on in town. Something is stealing Gwyn's magic. Wells, Gwyn, and some of the new Witches from the university are trying to solve the problem.I loved the plot of this story even more so than The Ex Hex. I think the pacing is superb and I loved all of the new characters that we meet throughout the book. The romance was full of spice, but didn't take away from the plot of the story, it just added to it!I really hope the author writes more books about this town and these characters because I love them so much.Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for an eARC in exchange for an honest review."

In all seriousness though, The Kiss Curse is the perfect blend of spoopy season vibes and romance, and was the perfect start to my Halloween reads! I was obviously sold on the enemies-to-lovers romance between Gwyn & Wells, their banter is fantastic and there's so many great lines in this book! This was just fantastic! Thank you Netgalley & Avon and Harper for the arc!"
538,17,The Kiss Curse,Erin Sterling,538,2022-10-16,Danielle,5,Even better than The Ex Hex! It needed a little more cat content lol I love this spooky szn series.

539,17,The Kiss Curse,Erin Sterling,539,2022-11-09,Anindita ლ,4,"I didn't like The Ex Hex all that much, but this one was even more sweet, humorous, and enjoyable. It is a good companion sequel to The Ex Hex, and I actually think I liked it more than the first one.I really struggled to connect with the main characters in the first book of the series, but thank goodness Gwyn's funny, feisty, clever cousin was such a likeable supporting character and that her own novel had such a cute, romantic enemies-to-lovers premise!Gwyn is sassy and has a clear sense of what she wants out of life. She is incredibly devoted to the people she loves, and I adore her spunky. Up until Rhys' older brother Wells arrives in town and opens up a comparable store directly across the street while she manages the family business. She has a great deal of hatred for Wells and is furious that he made this decision.Gywn and Wells were a delight to read about due to their chemistry that was hot and their competitive personalities. And I adored how they gravitated toward one another in times of need. It was the ideal balance of romance and adventure, all in all.The book's pacing is excellent, and I adored all of the new characters we get to know along the way. The relationship provided a lot of spice to the novel without detracting from its overall plot.Another factor that just increased its enjoyment was the fantasy elements there. Everything was kept extremely straightforward and in good humor. the perfect beginning to your Halloween or fall readings, with just the right amount of romance and spookiness!Just a little more time at the end would be nice because I feel like it ended too quickly.Try reading this if you enjoy stories with witches, Halloween-inspired themes, cranky characters, and fantasy!"

543,18,Dating Dr. Dil,Nisha Sharma,543,2022-11-24,Hannah B.,1,"✨Catch me ADDING cobwebs to my vagina.✨This man…murdered my libido. I deserve a fucking trophy for *finishing* this book because as I just said, I don’t have that ability anymore. I can’t possibly have had a worse experience. I will say, the sexual tension between me and DNFing this book was hot as shit... But I fucked around and found out so you don’t have to. I was the shrew we met along the way and have no problem taking one for the team and writing a very angry, very negative review. This book turned ME into the romance hero we deserved. I was clenching my jaw and grunting and being generally moody during this entire experience.✨My thoughts summed up if you want to tap out of the rest of my obviously unhinged review: This is actually the worst book I've read in a long time. Prem is a monster of a character and I cannot believe Kareena had to fall in love with him. I feel……so bad for her.✨Now for the brave fools, giddy up because we ride at dawn.Two things that made hating this book worse: I really liked Kareena and there was really dirty sexy sex. I hate that this book wasted those two things! But! When a hero is as fucked up as Prem, I don’t want to see him end up with Kareena, nor do I want to witness him having orgasms. No happy ending(s) for you motherfucker. Kareena’s family was trash to her for the entire book which was obviously WONDERFUL for the vibes of this book. She got shit on left and right and I am TIRED. I did adore how she read Prem to filth on television and attacked him with Pedialyte…but she took back that rat bastard way too quickly (in my opinion taking him back at ALL is too quickly).✨Prem is the type of dude to make anonymous thirst trap videos for tiktok where he’s riding a chair in broad daylight next to a pile of dirty laundry and a remote without the battery cover, but then hates on tiktok in the group chat. He knows he’s hot as shit and he’s very annoying about it. He doesn’t believe in love because of course he doesn’t. He calls Kareena a single old woman with expectations (love) too high but still wants to fuck her and her sweater vest collection because of course he does. Prem invited Kareena's sister on his talk show under false pretenses. They were not going to be discussing the benefits of love, no. They were actually going to be using Bindu's engagement as a case study to prove that love doesn't exist and how she is just with her fiance out of convenience. Real stand up guy. I disliked Bindu greatly but no one can top Prem. He’s consistently like “what did I do wrong,” “why isn’t Rina happy with me,” “what happened?” and I just need to scream YOU THAT’S WHAT HAPPENED you-oO-OOBut my favorite thing, my FAVORITE thing, is that this man calls his penis, CHARLIE. And no it is never explained! And no it is never revealed to Kareena. She got dickfished! It is SO unfair that she never found out he’s a fucking weird ass. I mean she found out he was a monster and still wanted to meet his *Charlie* so the jury is still out on her judgement. I’ve attached some LOVELY quotes at the end of the review for your enlightenment. I, for one, need an exorcism.I could’ve handled The Charlie if I’d have liked Prem…which was physically impossible for me to do. My one star review is for me fundamentally despising Prem and his fundamental fuckboyness that never improved. Charlie is just a bonus. A garnish if you will. The author’s explanation for Charles can be found here and I will question to the end of my days why the explanation was fully deleted from the book. I still wouldn’t have liked it but at least I would’ve had context. I’ve never read a 90s romance so I simply wasn’t bodily prepared for having my cousin’s name dick slap me. It’s so unfortunate this book is open door. I bet you’re thinking WHAAAAAT Hannah is mad at sex? Yes, because this man deserves zero orgasms. I don’t want to see him in the throes of pleasure. He deserves to have his dick explode like that blueberry bitch. Enjoy the blue balls motherfucker and get Charlie AND YOUR CUMFACTORY outta my life. The sex was hot yeah, but *Charlie* made it a threesome every time in the worst way. And so many of the word choices were WRONG. I enjoyed none of the sex scenes because Prem is a soggy douche canoe with holes I don’t want to see filled.My second favorite thing, nearly tied for first, is that this man said “Rina, honey” just about 50 times. For one, he started calling her honey WAY too soon. For all the marbles, IT WAS HORRIBLE. It made me sick. It rivaled Tessa Bailey’s obsession with “baby girl.” He “Rina, honeyed” all over this goddamn book like a randy youth..✨This next section is mainly going to be quotes because I! just! can’t! let! them! go!- Prem: ""You're the type of old single woman who blames her lack of a love life on people who view relationships practically.""- Prem: ""Why so hostile?"" he taunted. ""Is it because you finally realized that I'm right? That love is a bullshit excuse that women like you use when no one wants them?""- Normally Charlie needed a moment to catch its breath, but nope. Not this time. His adrenaline pumped through his body like he'd just ingested narcotics and his dick was at half chub.- An idea formed in his head, one that even had his Charlie twitching in his pants.- Charlie threatened to poke a hole through his pants, he was so turned on.- Prem: ""Rina, honey"" 10 million times- ""Kareena, that guy wanted to go down to brown-town.""- Kareena: ""I want you to eat me.""- When he pushed down his boxer briefs, his penis practically popped out and whacked her in the eyeballs.- his mushroom head- The sound of his sac slapping against her ass- Prem: ""Can you tell me?"" he blurted out. ""Tell me how a beautiful, vibrant person like you believes in a house filled with memories? Why do you think love is more than an illusion? That love can sustain a relationship for years?""- Charlie bounced up like a spring, immediately at full staff.- Bobbi to Kareena: ""God, does your waxer find cobwebs in your coochie?""- Prem: ""Google, play Dudes' Night playlist.""✨I cared about very little of this book. I skimmed all of her dating app and text messages. I skipped all of her “bad dates” because they literally didn’t matter and tried to convince me that Prem wasn’t THAT bad. I also skimmed a lot of other filler shit because I could; the book seemed endless. Sue me. I nearly tapped out on page one when it was revealed that Kareena works at a company called: Women Who Work. I then almost stopped when Prem attempted to Gotcha! Bindu and tell her that her engagement was both a farce and doomed on television. I nearly left the group chat when he called Kareena an ""old single woman"" and a ""woman who uses love as an excuse as to why no one wants her."" But it was actually when Charlie entered stage left that made me keep reading so I could write this review.Overall, I’d be semi okay with this book and the setup if Prem was a completely different character. I just can’t get behind her forgiving him so fast and him not changing at all. He was so righteous and smug. I did not believe his character was capable of fundamentally changing his horrible horribleness. His words during their viral fight were spoken with his WHOLE chest. The misogynistic shit that he spewed was so offensive and disgusting. But even then, the writing was clunky and fifteen pages in aged me five years. One star is given to Kareena and nothing/ no one else. ⭐️/5 🌶🌶🌶.5*/5*It’s hot but it’s also NOT worth it nor actually hot because Prem is horrible and makes everything horrible with Charlie. Ol Chuck and his mushroom head barely make this a 3🌶 read. ✨Hannah’s Hot Tips for reading this book:1. Don’t2. If you do, read all of their italicized thoughts in a Batman voice, it’ll make them tolerable and considerably less creepy 3. Skip all text messages and dating app messages. They’re worthless and boring and severely unfunny. They will take you out of the story because real people don’t punctuate like that.4. Control alt delete any references of the following: Charlie, Charlie at half chub, “Rina, Honey,” sweater vest, pouty lips, italicized thoughts, literally Charlie can fuck off, rhetorical questions, exclamation points, any time Prem thinks, Women Who Work being a legit company name, any time Prem talks, honestly control alt deleting the entire book may be the best for your health 5. Expect to laugh only from the pain and horror of what you’re reading 6. Say “Google, play Dudes’ Night Playlist!” out loud for a Really Good Time7. Don’t hold this book against Taylor Swift…Taylor honey you didn’t deserve this8. If you do not believe me that this book is THAT bad (you should but I get it) I suggest you go to my bookstagram. In my rage reacts highlight you will find proof almost as ample as Prem finds Kareena’s breasts in her sweater vests.✨ ❤️ More quotes ❤️- ""Do you go to bars pretending to be chill until you can trap someone into believing in your warped vision of true love?""- Prem: ""I fix broken hearts.""- Her shoulders were slumped, and that full curved mouth was set in a glossy pout. She'd piled that thick black hair on top of her head in a messy ponytail, and the glasses did nothing to hide her large brown eyes. Her prim and proper outfit was somehow sensual as her sweater vest clung to the swell of her breasts.---I too pile hair into a ponytail and have breasts so every outfit is sensual.- Prem: ""I think she's accepted that I don't believe an emotion that I have literally referred to as an illusion is the foundation of a relationship.""- Prem: ""Today, we're going to talk about how love is actually dangerous for heart health. Because love, ladies and gentleman, is an illusion that does not sustain long-term partnership.""- Kareena: ""My glasses...gah!""- ""I'm trying to tell you that maybe love doesn't exist!

544,18,Dating Dr. Dil,Nisha Sharma,544,2022-05-21,sam,3,the way i probably would’ve rated this higher if he didn’t refer to his 🍆 as charlie every 5 mins🚶‍♀️ what’s up with that anyway
545,18,Dating Dr. Dil,Nisha Sharma,545,2022-12-14,chan ☆,3,i get that it's the technical term but i cannot stand the word penis in smutty scenes. it feels clinical. and it conjures images of a skinny lil thing. please no.
546,18,Dating Dr. Dil,Nisha Sharma,546,2022-12-20,Nilufer Ozmekik,5,"I am so sure I will show my excitement in the most unusual ways! Probably some awkward sounds like cheering chicken gurgling its throat with Glenlivet ( trust me I always do the exact same sound when I get extra cheerful: like seeing my husband bring me boxes of wines to make me shut up or while I’m counting Ryan Gosling’s abs muscles aloud! ) I also screamed several Wows, Whoopsies and Whoas ! You may get from my reactions what I mean: this book is absolutely BIG WINNER!Most of you read my reviews know what I’m exactly looking for when I start a steamy, hilarious romcom!I like good character development! I like sassy, sarcastic banters. I’m true fan of Enemies to Lovers troupe! I like steamy scenes as I’ve mentioned before. I like great humor, good side characters. I like good conflicts! Finally I love big gestures! Maybe I got a little carried away and gave some semi spoilers by summarizing some important facts of the book. But this book seems like written for me! It checked all those boxes and answered all my expectations! So I already reserved its place at my top five best romcoms of 2022 even though I only read a few romcom arcs. But I’m telling you my friends this book so definitely different, special and if you’re fan like reading sexy, steamy, smart, entertaining, laugh out loud romance books and crave for ultra delicious Indian food, this book is match made in heaven for you! Well, Prem means “Love”, Dil means “Heart “in Hindi language and a man who is called with those names is pure scientist who’s insisting love doesn’t exist! Yes, this guy believes love is an illusion, a chemical reaction that endangers the hearts! We can start booing our hero! But don’t worry! He will make it up to us on several occasions during our reading journey! And absurd thing about this doctor is he’s stuck with a woman who’s love obsessed, humiliating him in front of the viewers, losing his sponsorship from investors, threatening his entire career! Thanks to bunch of 4 aunties who force him to earn blessings of Kareena Mann! They’ve met at the bar when Kareena stayed to have one more drink to celebrate her 30th birthday that her parents forgot! She met Prem( a.k.a. Dr. Dil) They had long conversation and learned a lot about each other. ( we will read parts from those long conversation during the related chapters!) When they decided to make up at the back office of bar, Prem got a phone call for family emergency and when he returned back he found the office empty! Kareena already left the building.  Their story starts like this. And when Kareena is drawn in Dr. Dil’s filming show by her irritating, extremely spoiled, influencer sister Bindu. He realizes the man on the show is the same guy who ditched her and she listens Prem’s humiliating comments about love which is probably last straw! She gets pissed. Things get escalated and viral. Now they should fake their relationship because Prem needs to fix his tarnished reputation and Kareena needs a fiancée to convince her father to give the money he saved for her marriage to pay for their family house which has sentimental value for her. Both of them can get benefited from this arrangement. Love is not on the cards. Prem doesn’t believe in love and Kareena can’t fall for a robot like him who feels nothing. But… well you can guess that’s not how it goes, right! Oh my goodness! This book is sooooo freaking AMAZING! Just focus on blazing five stars I gave and please read it and then thank me for my recommendation!  I’m so sure this will be a big hit! And I’m so excited to read more works of the author in near future! Special thanks to NetGalley and Avon and Harper Voyager, dear Nisha Sharma for sharing this digital reviewer copy with me in exchange my honest thoughts."

THIS IS LITERALLY THE BEST BOOK I'VE READ SO FAR THIS YEAR. I'M GONNA TRY TO EXPLAIN WHY BUT HONESTLY YOU CAN NOT UNDERSTAND PERFECTION UNTIL YOU EXPERIENCE IT SO READ THIS BOOK!!Prem & Rina's TSwift Playlist: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3tF...
""If love existed, this woman would have his heart, and he'd willingly take his scalpel to carve it out and give it to her.""
General Review:This is literally perfect in every aspect whether its writing style, plot, characters, pacing, EVERYTHING. You've got an amazing independent woman who knows her worth, a successful respectful attractive man, AND a fake dating trope WITH JUST THE PERFECT AMOUNT OF DESPERATION AND MOTIVE. AND THEY'RE BOTH SWIFTIES. AND THE SMUT IS SO FUCKING GOOD TOO.  I also absolutely loved learning about Indian culture too. I went into this book knowing almost knowing about it and then I found that its actually quite similar to my own culture (middle eastern/Egyptian) and it's so intriguing AND I WANNA TRY PARANTHAS NOW!! I also strongly related to Rina and Prem's conversation about their connection to their immigrant family because I too am an immigrant and I love that there's this representation here. I not only fell in love with the characters, and culture, but I found it so easy to connect to it too which is everything I love in a book. Miss Nisha Sharma HAS MADE MAGIC.Characters:Kareena - SHE IS WHAT I ASPIRE TO BE. ANNOYING MC?? FORGET THAT. She's gorgeous, has her dream job, knows her worth, and won't take shit from anybody.Prem - THIS MAN IS PERFECT. He cares and he listens and is so supportive AHHHH WHERE DO I BUY ONE??????? He literally didn't miss one thing she told him even in passing and I wish I had someone who listened to me this much he's also got the perfect amount of seasoning (trauma ;) ) Also I wish I knew what in his life prompted him to call his dick Charlie...you cannot tell me it just came out of nowhere 😭Bindu/ Dadi/ Rina's dad - I have a love/hate relationship with them because of how much they resemble my own family in the toxicity aspect (especially toxicity that stems from a thousand-year-old culture). I kind of completely hate Bindu though.The aunties - I LOVE THEM. They seem so fun and supportive and make the best food and have the best gossip and I just need to hang out with them. But also if I were in Kareena's position I would hate the overwhelming meddling.Bindu & Veera - They remind me of my own best friends and how I can go to them for anything and have these deep conversations and help me figure out anything SO I LOVE THEM TOO. Also, I just KNOW something is going on with Veera and Deepak.Favorite Scenes:- Meeting at bar- Allergic reaction at cafe- Met Museum - Shed smut- Prem going after Rina when he finds out she's at a guy's house- Going to Prem's apartment for the first time- Shower scene- PEPPERMINT CREAMER- Kidnapping Rina- ""I love you"""
554,18,Dating Dr. Dil,Nisha Sharma,554,2022-03-10,RateTheRomance,2,"I really liked—no LOVED—this book...until a little more than half way through. Then it just went completely off the rails for me and never recovered. DATING DR. DIL has a lot of good parts: great stories framed in Indian-American culture, laugh-out-loud moments, a strong and smart female lead, and a doctor who starts out dreamy and then fizzles...along with the writing.Okay, let's address my first major problem with DATING DR. DIL. The male lead, Prem, is a HEART SURGEON. He's a grown-ass man in his mid-30s who owns a cushy NYC penthouse apartment and is very successful. He also refers to his own dick, by name, in the third person. YOU READ THAT RIGHT. With no explanation offered whatsoever, Prem unironically repeatedly refers to his penis as Charlie. This appears in the book 7+ times. And just in case you think this might be not-awkward, I present the following excerpts from the book (prepare for the ew-factor):Immediately after sex: ""He was already ready to go again. Normally Charlie needed a moment to catch its breath, but nope. Not this time. ""Or this gem:""He shifted, drawing up his knees to hide the fact that Charlie wanted to come out to play."" And don't forget the awkwardness of this sex scene moment:""Prem felt Charlie tighten, but he wasn’t ready. Not yet."" Or during sexytime in the shower:""...she squeezed a healthy glob of soap into her palm and began sudsing him up starting with his shoulders and moving over his chest down toward Charlie.""Besides the really awkward Charlie moments, Prem was wildly immature. There is a major conflict scene towards the end in which Prem confronts the female lead's family at a huge party (for the sister's engagement) and says the following to her sister (whom he has met twice, at most):“What, you think because you’re spoiled, you can treat people like garbage? Your sister is twice as beautiful as you’ll ever be, and she isn’t a bitch.” Ummmm....yeah. Not cool. For my taste, a male lead needs to be respectful towards ALL women not just HIS woman. I really hated this part. You can stand up for your love interest by expressing disappointment in her sister's actions, but you are not gonna call any female a bitch at her own engagement party in front of her future in-laws.There are also quite a few problems with the writing itself: often repeated phrases, continuity issues, serious holes in the plot, and even a scene where Prem runs his hands up the female's BACK to grab her boobs. The boobs located on her back, apparently. Story errors like this happened over and over again.This book had so much promise, but it just did not work for me. I received a gifted copy of this title in exchange for an honest review.RATING:⭐️⭐️STEAM LEVEL: Rated NC-17 TRIGGERS: past death of fiance, aneurism, past death of parentFEELS-O-METER: 2/5 - A bit of drama, but still a pretty light read. 👇🏻HANG OUT WITH ME HERE!👇🏻 INSTAGRAM | YEAR OF SMUT CHALLENGE"

556,18,Dating Dr. Dil,Nisha Sharma,556,2022-03-14,Karla Espinosa,4,"I enjoyed this book sooooo much more than I thought I would! I expected a cute little rom-com but it ended up being so much more! My favorite part had to be the main character, Kareena, and her level of relatability. I mean she's an independent, hard-working, romance novel-loving, Taylor Swift fanatic, hopeless romantic woman. She's aware of her self-worth and refuses to settle for less. The cultural aspects were another favorite of mine. Of course, her love story with Prem was everything and more! If you're looking for a spicy rom-com that's going to keep you interested throughout the whole book, then this is perfect for you! "
557,18,Dating Dr. Dil,Nisha Sharma,557,2022-04-12,Maria,5,"Quick Note: I see a lot of people being upset by the Charlie thing. Perhaps this is just the elder millennial in me, but I remember a time when people were embarrassed to use the actual names of genitalia and assigned euphemisms or nicknames that were more palatable. Like the word ""monkey"" for vagina or referring to one's penis as their ""Johnny Ringo"". It was a dark ridiculous time. It is a little odd that he refers to his dick as Charlie in his internal monolog, but not a deal breaker for me. Original Review4.5 I rounded up, despite the excessive amount of pro-sweater vest propaganda, because this novel addressed very real issues, like the ingrained misogyny and colonialism in brown communities, in such a thoughtful way it separated itself from the standard romantic fluff. The way the author wrote a family that was loving, but had some toxic behaviors was brilliant. Often fictional families are depicted as perfect or absolutely horrible, but that's not how things really are. People who love us can sometimes do very hurtful and harmful things to us without it meaning they hate us. And certain things like unprocessed grief can become so normal we no longer see the influence they have over our lives. Family dynamics are complex and breaking from generational toxicity can be difficult. This book also had the most realistic kidnapping scene in a rom com that I've ever read/seen. Can't wait for the rest of the series."
558,18,Dating Dr. Dil,Nisha Sharma,558,2022-03-12,romancelibrary,2,"I received an ARC from Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review.Dating Dr. Dil was one of my highly anticipated reads of the year. I expected a fun Desi romantic comedy with flawed characters to root for. I'm not sure what the author was aiming for, but the storytelling is chaotic, the dialogues are cringy, and every single character is awful and has little to no development.Dating Dr. Dil is an enemies to lovers romance, with a dash of fake dating. It's also loosely based on The Taming of the Shrew. First of all, the connection between Prem and Kareena? Insta-lust. They're also both incredibly annoying. Kareena, in particular, crossed a line with her behaviour, which she never apologized for. The enemies aspect of the romance did not work well - Prem and Kareena came across as juvenile and asinine. Their childish behaviour was supposed to be comedic, but it only succeeded in annoying the hell out of me. In terms of characterization, Prem's passion and motivation to build a community clinic is easy to understand. But there's nothing to show the motivation behind Kareena's professional choices.The romance slightly improved when Prem and Kareena got over their childish behaviour and went on fun dates together. Kareena believes in love. Prem doesn't believe in love. Kareena wants him to say the words. Prem doesn't want to say the words. It's the most annoying type of conflict. That being said, I liked the conversation between Prem and his mom. Most Asian families value actions over words. They don't go around saying ""I love you"" to each other. Instead, they show their love through actions and sacrifices. The author didn't specifically highlight this as a cultural thing, but I still appreciated the fact that Prem had a conversation with his mom about saying the words ""I love you."" With a few exceptions, the dialogues are awkward, cringy, and stilted. Some of the Aunty dialogues made me think, ""A desi aunty would never have used these words."" It's almost as if the author was stuck between appealing to her Desi audience and her non-Desi audience. The author tried hard to make it look like she was demolishing stereotypes, but in my opinion, she just ended up reinforcing these stereotypes. Why does every Desi romance have to be about arranged marriage vs. love marriage? Our culture is not limited to rishtas. Why do Desi authors amplify this aspect of our culture, to the point where it feels like a caricature and mockery? There was some commentary about how Desi women are negatively impacted by cultural expectations about marriage, but it didn't have a strong impact on me."

563,18,Dating Dr. Dil,Nisha Sharma,563,2022-03-28,Ayushi (bookwormbullet),5,"DATING DR. DIL IS OUT TODAY!! GO READ IT RIGHT NOW!!Thank you so much to Avon for providing me with an eARC in exchange for an honest review! And thank you so much to Nisha for sending me a personalized ARC 🥺I'M OBSESSEDDDD. In case you’ve been living under a rock and haven’t heard of this DELIGHTFUL adult romcom releasing on March 15, Dating Dr. Dil is a South Asian remix of Taming of the Shrew that follows Kareena Mann, a love-obsessed homebody, and Dr. Prem Verma, a love-phobic TV doctor, who get into a viral argument about love on the set of Prem’s TV show, The Dr. Dil Show. Even though the two have conflicting views on love-matches and arranged-matches, the more time Prem spends with Kareena, the more he begins to believe she’s the woman he wants to spend the rest of his life with. But for Prem and Kareena to find their happily ever after, they must admit that hate has turned into fate.I've read every single one of Nisha's previous works and they're all amazing, but this is so clearly her best work and I cannot recommend Dating Dr. Dil enough for romance readers. It combines the best aspects of all of her books--the desi magic from My So-Called Bollywood Life, the grounded relationship in Radha & Jai’s Recipe for Romance, and the fierce and swoonworthy romance of The Singh Family Trilogy. It's hilarious, and emotional, and steamy, and so much fun. If there’s one thing that Nisha knows how to write well, it’s a male main character who’s utterly and completely obsessed with the female main character before he even realizes it. The lengths Prem goes to keep Kareena in his life in this novel was so much fun to see. From pani puri eating competitions, to murder mystery scavenger hunts at the Met, to “kidnapping” Kareena and whisking her away to his home to spend the night with her, this man was DOWN BAD and I was here for every second of it. I also have to talk about the novel’s main character, Kareena Mann, Jersey’s resident sweater vest baddie, and tell y’all why I love her so much. Kareena’s character means everything to me. It’s not everyday brown women are leads in western romance books to begin with, and just seeing her front and center on the cover makes me so happy. Also, the fact that she wears glasses?! I need more glasses-wearing FMCs in my romance books, please and thank you.Going into Kareena’s personality and character, I think the main reason why I loved her, and why so many other brown readers have loved her as well, is because of her no B.S. attitude. While Kareena is inspired by Kate from Taming of the Shrew, her personality means so much more in the context of South Asian communities and values. She refuses to lower her standards to meet the standards of her potential suitors, stands up to her dad to let her keep their family home, and straight up tells Prem that she’ll only have him if he reciprocates her love. She does this all on her own, but also with the help of her aunties, who all consider her as their own after her mother’s passing. Amidst the “Sharam nahi aati?” and “Log kya kahenge?” mentalities of many people within the South Asian community IRL (Mrs. W.S. Gupta, I’m looking at you, girl), Kareena and her non-toxic meddling aunties are a breath of fresh air. I also loved Kareena’s support system made up of Bobbi and Veera and I’m very excited to potentially read their books next 👀Moving to Dr. Dil himself, there is a clear juxtaposition of Prem’s character against Kareena’s, which was done really well in my opinion, especially in the context of how desi men are treated in South Asian communities. In Dating Dr. Dil, Prem is 100% a desi f-boy as he claims, and it’s apparent how, as a South Asian man, he faces more privileges than Kareena does in their desi community. Even after Prem loses his late fiancé, Gori, he isn’t shamed for being single and seeking a new wife just like Kareena fears she will be if things don’t work out with Prem. Additionally, Prem is coddled by his mother at several points throughout the novel (as, let’s face it, many South Asian men are) whereas Kareena has to repeatedly stand up for herself to her father and grandmother. This contrast between the two leads, combined with their contrasting views on love and marriage, was done incredibly well IMO and I admire Nisha for highlighting these double standards within some South Asian communities.All this to say that Dating Dr. Dil has some of the best South Asian-American rep that I’ve seen (but you knew that already), combined with filmy magic and the best romance tropes. Trust that Prem and Kareena will steal your heart immediately from the first few chapters. Nisha Sharma is a true champion to South Asian readers and I cannot thank her enough for providing readers like me with such incredible stories. This delightful novel is out now, and I hope you love Kareena and Prem as much as I did! Follow me on

Even though she has a successful career, she hasn't been successful in life according to her family because she's still single. Prem, on the other hand, is still single because he lost someone in his life and doesn't believe in love. Kareena and Prem meet and have a one night stand gone wrong. Kareena is humiliated and angry, so when she sees Prem at a work event for her sister, she goes off on him. On a live stream. The world knows they hate each other, but they both need to get married for different reasons and decide to fake date to get what they want for their professional lives. Kareena is still trying to date on apps and with people her aunties set her up with, but it's impossible to find someone genuine and who she could see herself with. Unless she's on a fake date with Prem, that is. The two can't stop thinking about each other. I loved how they were fake dating and would rather be with each other than trying to date other people. Prem did get frustrating with how he would not go all in with Kareena because he was STILL adamant that love didn't exist. He had a lot to go through, though, which he eventually does before the end of the book. There was a lot going on in the plot of book and a lot of family dynamics, but I ended up enjoying that and this romance! "

570,19,The Wedding Crasher,Mia Sosa,570,2023-03-02,Ayman,4,"fake dating is always gonna hit every single damn time. this was a cute, funny (like i actually LOLed), fast, and swoon worthy read. i knew there was something about dean and solange as soon as i read about them in “the worst best man.”there’s something about a man that “doesn’t believe in love” and a women who does dynamic that’s always gonna be my bread and butter. dean is the type of guy that’s overly organized and it’s the way that solange disrupts his peace that had me giggling and kicking my feet in bed. he was so miserable and pathetic towards the end and it was sooo poetic to me 😩this is definitely a step up from “the worst best man” and honestly everything it should have been. this one is definitely the strongest out of the two. the banter, the sarcasm, the equal parts humor, and romance was too fucking good. ending was kinda rushed but still had me smiling "
571,19,The Wedding Crasher,Mia Sosa,571,2022-10-20,Nilufer Ozmekik,4,"Can you imagine to fall for a woman who ruined your wedding day, faking to be a your girlfriend to save your career! Yes, another fake relationship, not enemies but partly strangers/ opposites to lovers troupes hook you from the beginning!  Of course entertainment and so much laugh out loud moments are guaranteed when you read from Worst Best Man’s brilliant author Mia Sosa ! Another best part of the book is the main character Dean Chapman is best friend of Worst Best Man’s Max! Whoop whoop! It’s pleasure to welcome one of my favorite characters back!  As I mentioned Dean’s wedding ceremony was ruined when Solange Pereira decided to intervene and push the bride tell the truth about her feelings. ( Solange was at the wedding for helping her cousin: but her eavesdropping of bride and her childhood friend’s private conversation which includes bride’s love confession to him, changed everything. She thought the bride was making a mistake by marrying with Dean. She had to mind her own business and shut up but did she do it, nope! She crashed the wedding!)  Interestingly Dean didn’t show any dramatic reaction after finding out his bride never fell for him. The wedding idea was the part of his long check list for a man like him who’s uptight, reasonable planner who focuses his goals and believes the importance of the structure helps him stay grounded. At least he’s honest with his opinions and lack of feelings.  But when he blurts out the lie that Solange who prevented him to marry with Ella, is his longtime friend he starts having feelings for, things get changed. He meets with Solange to convince her for fake dating for a few work meetings to guarantee his partnership. Of course Solange accepts his offer to make it up for him. She still feels bad for ruining her wedding. There’s nothing possibly happen between two polar opposite people! Solange who is adventurous, hilarious, entertaining, eccentric. They’re like ice and fire! But what if the attraction takes control and push them do things they never imagine! Well: the ideas of Solange and Dean’s adventurous dating journey were amazingly creative including accidentally finding themselves in sex party, getting listed for throwing axes, karaoke night which ends Dean’s singing Ginuwine’s Pony while he’s performing Magic Mike’s delicious moves ( okay, I admit this is the most entertaining and hottest parts of the book)  I loved both of the characters and their sizzling chemistry. Only two bad things kept me give more stars : I found some chapters a little wordy. With less depictions and more dialogues, it could be easier to concentrate to the main story. And I have to admit, I found Dean a little obnoxious at first, it took a little time for me to like him but how can I resist to a character who can dance ( or whatever he does) like Magic Mike! I’m giving four definitely enjoyable, smart, laugh out loud, hilarious stars! I absolutely read anything this amazing author writes without thinking any further.Special thanks to NetGalley and Avon and Harper Voyager for sharing this digital reviewer copy with me in exchange my honest thoughts."
572,19,The Wedding Crasher,Mia Sosa,572,2022-08-09,Madita,2,"Updated rating: 2 - 2.5 stars Someone just reminded me of the pussy poem eher he talks about how much he loves it. I don’t know how I did not remember this but now I cannot look at Dean the same way again. So my rating has been lowered. I will still say that I can’t dislike Solange bc I really enjoy her character and Dean was one of my favorites in the first book but wow. ——————Old review: This is a romantic comedy 10000000%Now about the characters: Dean was a good guy from the beginning and I loved how he finally got out of his shell in the end for Solange. Solange was funny , sweet and just super caring especially with her family. It made me love the entire universe even more and whenever Max and Alina showed up I got happy. "
573,19,The Wedding Crasher,Mia Sosa,573,2022-04-09,Mika Auguste,3,"this book started off SO good, but somehow fell flat for me once i got to the halfway mark. i did receive this as an ARC pretty early on and wonder if the finished copy might tie together some of the problems i have with the plot and pacing. the characters also really didn’t have any chemistry and i found that i was forcing myself to actually finish reading this book. i really did have high expectations considering how much i absolutely loved The Worst Best Man by this author, so overall i’m kind of sad i didn’t enjoy this book as much as i thought i was going to in the end2.5 stars but rounding to 3"
574,19,The Wedding Crasher,Mia Sosa,574,2022-08-04,Warda,5,"Quite frankly, I feel high. High on my emotions. High on happiness. High. Happy to the point where I feel slightly delirious. Is Mia Sosa becoming an all-time favourite author of mine after only reading two books by her? Possibly. I told you I’m high. I don’t even have any experience in that arena, but let me tell you I understand addictions. Alright, let’s chill. 🤐I had no expectations going into this book, to be honest. I loved The Worst Best Man, and I was anticipating Dean’s story, but I think there was a delay in this book being released, so the initial excitement I had waned a little even though I pre-ordered this. The meet-cute was hilarious. Our heroine crashes the wedding of the hero after overhearing that his soon-to-be-bride is in love with someone else. Said bride declared it out loud. Our heroine just couldn’t stand by and let the hero marry and so she blurts it out at the ceremony. Without knowing the full story.My girl was being a good Samaritan. Our hero knew that getting into this ‘marriage’ wasn’t going to be a traditional one. It was one of convenience. It would help with the job. They had certain things in common, it would have been a surface level relationship with no feelings involved. All because he lived in a rigid-like way and had goals to achieve.Honestly. Such idiocy. But a trauma response nonetheless.The hero and heroine proceed to fake-date for reasons that you can find out for yourself, because it’s hilarious, and banter and friendship flourishes from this setup. They form something neither were expecting and it’s fuckin’ delightful seeing them both navigate this through. Because there was a deal they had to uphold. But feelings got involved. Their chemistry was insane.Character driven stories are my thing, but this had plenty of plot to keep the story moving and it was entertaining as hell. The balance of heart and humour was done right for me. I always love it when vulnerabilities and traumas are explored in my stories and the side characters shined as much as our main characters too. So naturally, this story worked for me on every level. I had such an incredible time reading it! I really hope Mia Sosa has plans to continue on with the series."
575,19,The Wedding Crasher,Mia Sosa,575,2022-11-01,Kezia Duah,5,"Yes Sosa! You did that! Yes, another fake dating book. At this point, I’m pretty sure there are exactly 4,276 fake-dating books out there. Source: Trust me. I loved these characters! Every one of them is a certified comedian and I loved it. Books that make me laugh have my whole heart. I loved how pragmatic Dean was: a checklist kind of guy. My man gave Solange a printed study guide for a smooth fake dating experience *cackles uncontrollably*. We explored why he feels the need to be this way and it did make sense. It made me connect to him more. Of course, Solange was more on the opposite side, not completely, but she does have a little bit of a free spirit. I desperately need her to be my friend. Some parts of their interaction were definitely on the awkward side, but I found it awfully cute. I’m glad their relationship wasn’t some sort of instant attraction but a love that developed slowly and deeply. Not claiming this is a slow burn though but absolutely not insta love. I also enjoyed the really steamy times. Sosa did not come to play with those ones.I loved Solange’s family. I always get so jealous of characters with families like these that are really nosy but are always there for you. Even Dean wanted to get into the bliss that comes with a family like this. I don’t remember anything from The Worst Best Man 

, but per my rating it looks like I also really enjoyed it. That being said, I will be religiously looking forward to the rest of Sosa’s books."
576,19,The Wedding Crasher,Mia Sosa,576,2022-08-24,Julie ,2,"The Wedding Crasher by Mia Sosa is a 2022 Avon publication. The premise here is a familiar one- the fake date/ opposites attract trope/ romantic comedy. The reviews for this convinced me to add it to my TBR list, and the blurb did sound promising. The story was a mixed bag for me, though. I’ve made it to a point where some humor and some threads that are now commonplace in nearly every romance novel are getting old or missing the mark for me...Or maybe I’m just getting old. But- the story was also too busy for me, with too many characters, too many fake relationships, and all that chemistry everyone was raving about was MIA for me. That said, I did like the big Brazilian family and cute way the story wrapped up and there were one or two hilarious moments that made me laugh- but the story didn’t have the sparkle or emotional depth I prefer in my romance novels. Overall, I’m an outlier on this one. I wish there was a way to tell which one of these ‘cartoon’ cover romances will be a good fit for me, as it is getting harder and harder to get a feel for them in advance. I took a chance on this one and it didn’t work out quite like I had hoped… but I think I’m in the minority here- so by all means make sure you read through all the positive reviews for this one. You might have better luck with it than I did."
577,19,The Wedding Crasher,Mia Sosa,577,2022-04-17,preoccupiedbybooks,3,"Cute and VERY steamy but a few too many relationships of convenience/fake dating going on for me! The plot was all over the place. I loved the worst best man, but this felt a little flat in comparison for me. It was still fun and hot, but dragged a little in the second half.I still loved the family and the Brazilian culture, and both Dean and Solange were decent characters. A pretty good read 🤵🤵🤵"
578,19,The Wedding Crasher,Mia Sosa,578,2022-04-11,Heather,3,"I enjoy this series a ton. I did like the first book, The Worst Best Man a little more but I think that's because it was the hate to love trope which is my all time favorite trope. This was equally adorable. steamy and I loved the chemistry between our 2 main characters. I did feel like the overall plot just kind of fell flat for me which is why I am rating it a 3 out of 5 but overall good romance read."
579,19,The Wedding Crasher,Mia Sosa,579,2022-11-07,Kat,4,"I really loved THE WORST BEST MAN which I read last year. In THE WEDDING CRASHER, Solange is helping her wedding planner cousin when she overhears that the bride is secretly in love with someone else. She… you guessed it… announces this at the wedding and it is called off. Later she and the ex-groom, Dean, begin fake dating because both need fake partners for different events and there was a spark.I had mixed feelings about this one. Things I LOVED. I thought the characters individually were so cute! I loved Solange and the way the author wrote her family and culture. I loved her relationship with her roommate and best friend (the bartender—so funny.) I loved Dean and his nemesis relationship with the other lawyer at work he was competing with. The dialogue in this was hilarious. I also thought that Dean and Solange started off with some amazing sparks and chemistry. I felt that the further I read, the more this sort of lost energy. I didn’t hate it and I finished it. But I would agree with other reviewers that said the first half of the book was stronger than the second. I still love this author and think she has a wickedly funny writing voice and I look forward to seeing what she writes next. 4/5 stars."

582,19,The Wedding Crasher,Mia Sosa,582,2022-03-24,Mara,4,"Honestly, the inclusion of a karaoke scene featuring Ginuwine's ""Pony"" bumped this from a 3.5 to a 4 star. This is one of the truest rom coms I've read, in terms of really following both the structure and humor type of a movie rom com. Plot wise, this totally worked for me, but I did feel like the characters were rather flat. Still, all around, this was super fun and a worth sequel IMO"

589,19,The Wedding Crasher,Mia Sosa,589,2022-03-04,trina (ryke meadows wife),4,"“It’s really that over the course of the weeks I’ve known you, I’ve gotten glimpses of what it would be like to be your person. I’ve gotten a taste of what it would be like to be the one loving you. And it kind of feels like an honor. Like maybe I don’t deserve you.”We have fake dating, and they’re sharing the same bed! Two tropes I love so much. Imagine the person who crashes your wedding turns out to be the love of your life? This rom-com was exactly what I needed. I could not stop laughing. This book follows Dean Chapman and Solange Pereira, they’re complete opposites. However, they miracously agree to fake date after she crashes Dean’s wedding, to help save Dean’s job! But their futures don’t align. Dean is a workaholic who thrives off planning goals for himself, and achieving it, so love doesn’t fit into his picture, and Solange knows that. She wants a partner that’ll be all in. It sounds like a recipe for disaster, so she constantly tries to convince herself that she shouldn’t develop any sort of attraction/feelings for Dean. I thought that it probably wouldn’t work.. How would it work? But GUYSSS. Watching Dean realize he might be catching feelings for Solange, he did things she loved, just because it makes her happy. The FASHION SHOW? UGH I LOVED THAT. THEIR FIRST KISS? I LOVED THAT TOO. HIM WANTING TO HAVE “THEIR OWN THING” UGH. The way Solange’s family accepted him? It felt like I was apart of their family too lol! I ADORED THE TIAS! The side characters were just as enjoyable! I loved her best friend, Brandon. I really hope his story is next. I also loved the cultural representation in this book as well! It really made me want to visit Brazil and try some of the delicious food the author described in the book!But you know what I loved most? The ENDING. Gosh! If my future partner doesn’t crash my wedding, then I don’t want you! Thank you so much Netgalley for the ARC!!!"

Mia Sosa writing style is so lovely there were so many funny moments in this book that I enjoyed it a lot. The best part were the character development it was so relatable.overall it is going to be one the sweet rom coms of 2022.My rating :4/5 starsSpice:2chillies"
595,19,The Wedding Crasher,Mia Sosa,595,2022-05-09,Irmak ☾,5,"so far, this is definitely my favorite romance of the year. i literally loved everything about it and it was such a fun read. "
596,19,The Wedding Crasher,Mia Sosa,596,2022-09-17,Jess Owens,4,"3.5I didn’t love this as much as The Worst Best Man. I didn’t connect to these characters like I did in the first book. There were moments where I felt like the characters stood out but it wasn’t the entire novel. The plot was fun and the karaoke scene was fantabulous. While reading this (I listened to the audio) I found myself frustrated with the lack of sexy times and lack of communicating feelings. And I realize these are hallmarks of romance, especially trad publishing. I need to seek out some indie bc the sex scenes were great but I wanted more (what does that say about me?) anyway still a fun time. "
597,19,The Wedding Crasher,Mia Sosa,597,2022-01-26,bruna,4,"How could I not love a romance where the heroine is American Brazilian? I’m glad to say that once again Mia Sosa presented the Brazilian culture in a respectful and engaging way. Every sentence in Portuguese and all the mentions about our food warmed my heart and made me giddy. Of course, I also loved the story because it delivered some of my favorite tropes: fake dating and mutual pining. Dean and Solange were a delight as a couple because you could really see they built a strong friendship and connection throughout the whole fake dating plot. Sometimes it even felt like I was reading a slow burn book since they both didn’t want to get involved in a romantic way and ruin everything. Besides that, most of their interactions were all over the place (in a good way) and genuinely funny so it’s safe to say that the book never got boring. I also loved Dean and Solange’s individual journeys, especially because the problems they were facing resonated a lot with me. Considering how different they were from each other, their obstacles also helped them realize that not everything is black and white and sometimes we need to let go and simply live. The family moments and MaxLina (from ""The Worst Best Man"") crumbs were definitely a plus!! I wish every set of secondary characters were as amusing and supportive as they were. All in all, I definitely recommend this book if you’re looking for a light read with diversity and great characters. *ARC kindly provided by Avon via Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review*"
598,19,The Wedding Crasher,Mia Sosa,598,2022-01-20,Nicole,4,"This book was so cute! It wasn’t overly mushy and the story was entertaining. Plenty of smut if that’s your thing. I enjoyed it.Solange Pereira is tasked with helping her wedding planner cousin with her first wedding. Things are going well until she hears a troublesome conversation between the bride Ella and a man who is not her fiancé. When the wedding commences, Solange decides she cannot remain quiet and urges the bride to follow her heart. Ella says she cannot through with the wedding.Dean Chapman had his life planned out. A check mark against each goal marriage was to be next. With his wedding canceled, he must reevaluate what comes next. Then comes the realization at work that he may not get the promotion he wanted without a significant other. He enlists the help of Solange to pose as his serious girlfriend.Solange and Dean fake-date their way through various situations until they face the truth. Have they developed very real feelings for each other?Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for this arc in exchange for my honest review."
599,19,The Wedding Crasher,Mia Sosa,599,2022-06-26,Sabi,3,"A very basic fake dating romance. Nothing new for me but maybe naive readers of the trope will like it more. Still, had some good fun situations.Also, those sexy scenes? Didn't expect them."
